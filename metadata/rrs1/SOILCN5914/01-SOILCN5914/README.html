<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (N) sub-plot data from the Highfield Bare Fallow experiment,  sampled eight times between 1959-2014. The experiment was ploughed out of old grassland (since 1838) in 1959 and has been kept in bare fallow since by cultivation to suppress weeds. No crops are grown. The data set contains SOC and total N as % and soil stock data, soil weights and soil pH in the topsoil (0-23cm).</p>
<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>The soil was sampled eight times between 1959 and 2014, in the summer/autumn, except in 1959 when it was sampled in December, before the grass was ploughed in.  There are four sub-plots. The stock of total soil N and SOC was calculated from %N and %SOC and the estimated soil weight, 0-23cm. %N and %SOC were  measured on air-dried soil, ground to &lt;2mm.</p>
<h3>Technical Info</h3>
<p>Soil pH was measured in water, with a 1:2.5 soil:water suspension, in air-dried soil, sieved &lt;2mm. Samples were analysed for %N by the Kjeldahl method (Bremner, 1965), 1959-1987, and by LECO combustion, based on the Dumas method, 2000-2014.  SOC was measured by the Tinsley method (Kalembasa &amp; Jenkinson, 1973) 1959-1987, and as total C by combustion (LECO) minus CaCO<sub>3</sub>-C by manometry, 2000-2014. Soil weights were measured in 1978 and 2000 and also in 2000 from an adjacent area of grassland, to give an estimate of starting value in 1959. Stocks of SOC and total N were calculated from %SOC and %N and estimated soil weight, 0-23cm.</p>

<h3>soil_data</h3>
<h4>Soil chemistry data</h4>
<p>The main data table containing soil chemistry data for the four sub-plots of the Highfield Bare Fallow experiment,  sampled eight times between 1959-2014. The experiment was established in 1959 by ploughing out very long-term grassland (since 1838). It has been kept bare since then by regular cultivation to suppress weeds. No crops are grown and there are no inputs of fertilizer or manure.  The 1959 data is from when the experiment was still under grassland.  The data includes soil organic carbon (SOC) and total soil nitrogen (N) as % and soil stock data; also soil weights and soil pH. Soil weights were measured in 1978 and 2000, and also in 2000 from an adjacent area of grassland, to give an estimated starting value in 1959. Soil weights were estimated in other years. </p>
