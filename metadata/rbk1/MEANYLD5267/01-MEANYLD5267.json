            "description": "The Broadbalk experiment started in autumn 1843, and for the first eight years, the fertilizer treatments were varied, to test specific questions. From 1852 a scheme of fertilizer treatments was established, which remained largely unaltered until 1967. The mean yields are taken from this period. The treatment strips extend the whole length of the field, each testing a different fertilizer or manure treatment.  \r\nFrom 1852-1925 winter wheat was grown <b>continuously</b>, apart from occasional fallowing fallowing (of the top or bottom half of the experiment) to control weeds. Weeds were originally controlled by hand-hoeing, but this became impractical, so sequential fallowing was introduced to control weeds. In 1926 the experiment was divided into five Sections (I-V), crossing the strips at right angles. After a <b>transition</b> period, a <b>fallow cycle</b> was introduced in 1931. Fallowing was mainly in a five-year rotation of one-year fallow with four successive crops of wheat. In 1955 Section I was divided into two; IA received herbicides as required and was no longer fallowed, IB continued in the five-year cycle. In 1955 Section V was divided into two; VB received a single application of lime, VA did not. In 1963 Section VB was no longer fallowed and received herbicides as required, while VA continued in the five-year fallowing cycle. The 10-year yields are means of all cropped sections, 1926-1967. "
