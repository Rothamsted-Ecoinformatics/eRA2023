The aim was to maintain soil pH above 7.5 and minimize the range of pH values within each Section. No chalk was required 1993-2007. As in earlier years, differential chalk applications were made to selected plots in 2008, 2014 and 2019, the amount applied depending on the soil pH.\n### Technical Info\nChalk application as tonnes CaCO<sub>3</sub> per hectare\n### Quality\nIn accordance with the Joint Code of Practice for Research at Rothamsted, data processing in e-RA follow rigorous standard operating procedures to ensure the quality and correctness of data collected in the field through to depositing in the e-RA database. Data checked by Andy Macdonald, Paul Poulton and Andy Gregory.\n",
