### Abstract
Details of the routine chalk (lime) applications to the Broadbalk Wheat Experiment, first applied in 1955. A regular scheme was introduced in 1956 and revised in 1976. The aim was to maintain soil pH above 7.5 and minimize the range of pH values within each Section. No chalk was required 1993-2007. As in earlier years, differential chalk applications were made to selected plots in 2008, 2014 and 2019, the amount applied depending on the soil pH.
### Technical Info
Chalk application as tonnes CaCO<sub>3</sub> per hectare

|harvest_year|Year in which crop harvested|year|default|https://schema.org/Date|Year in which the crop was harvested. It will generally have been sown the previous year.|
|strip|Fertilizer strip|string|default||Treatment strip, which runs the whole length of the experiment and crosses all the Sections. Each strip receives a different fertilizer or manure treatment. There are 20 different strips, numbered 01-22.|
|old_section|Old Section number|string|default||Old Section number. In 1926 the experiment was divided into five Sections (I - V), which crossed the different strips. Wheat was grown in a 5 year rotation with one year fallow, in sequence across the five Sections. In 1955 Section I was divided into Ia and Ib and Section V was divided into Va and Vb. Vb received lime in 1955. In 1968 the original five Sections (I-V) were divided into 10 new Sections (0-9).|
|section|Current section number|string|default||Current cropping section number, 0-9, since 1968. The Sections are either in continuous wheat (Sections 0, 1, 6, 8 and 9) or wheat in rotation with other arable crops (Sections 2-5 and 7).|

|crop|crop|string|default|http://aims.fao.org/aos/agrovoc/c_1972|Crop grown in that harvest year. Usually sown after the chalk was applied. Chalk generally not applied to section in fallow, except in 1968.|

|chalk_amount|Amount of chalk applied|number|default|http://aims.fao.org/aos/agrovoc/c_36454|The amount of ground chalk (lime) applied. Chalk was not usually applied to Sections in fallow that year, unless stated.|
