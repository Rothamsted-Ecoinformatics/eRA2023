2,"Section 8 (continuous wheat with no herbicides) was fallowed in this harvest year to control weeds, no N applied. FYM, castor bean meal and PKNaMg applied as usual. "

12,Oats introduced in 1996. FYM and N not applied 1996-2017. 
13,"Strip 12 received K2 (180 kgK) 2001-2005 plus 450kgK in the autumn of 2000, and Mg2 (24kgMg) 2001-2005 plus 60 kg Mg in the autumn of 2000.  "

15,"Strip 17 and 18 N rate changed in 2001, and received full PKMg (previously half rate since 1968).  "
16,Strip 19 changed from residual castor bean meal to N1+1+1 KMg in 2001
17,"Strip 1 FYM no longer applied from 2001, shown as (FYM), ie residual FYM. PK no longer applied  (see note 7)."

20,In 2006 strip 12 changed to N1+3+1 (P)KMg
21,2018 change of rotation to wheat>wheat>oats>wheat>beans
22,"Winter beans introduced in 2018, no FYM or N applied. "
23,From 2018 N to oats at half rate as a single application in mid-April
24,Winter oats replaced by spring oats in 2001 and 2020 due to poor weather delaying usual sowing
25,"2018 1st and 2nd split N applied on same date, 19/04/2018 strips 12, 17-19"
26,"In 2010 date of application of Mg and K* not in Yield Book. Assumed K* same as P fertilizer and Mg same as K, as in previous years. "
27,In 2012 date of application of Mg and K not in Yield Book. Assumed same as P and K* as in previous years.
28,2013 wheat crop very late sown due to wet autumn and winter delaying sowing. 
29,"2015 and 2020  spring wheat sown, as wet autumn and winter delayed sowing"
30,"2004 Section 8 strips 2.1, 2.2, 17-19 not harvested as the crop was badly laid (flattened). "
31,"1995 Section 9, strip 10 grain yield missing from e-RA dataset, value of 2.67 in Yield book for 1995. "
32,"1971. Section 8, strip 19 cut green, no yield taken"
33,"1987 straw yields missing from Section 1, strips 3 and 8. "
34,"2012 wheat straw yield missing from Section 1, strip 20 in e-RA data, value of 0.14 in Yield book for 2012"
35,2012 oats grain yield strip 1 and oats straw yield strip 2.1 estimated from the grain/straw ratio of plot 222 due to combine blockage
36,2013 wheat straw yield section 3 strip 17 was estimated using the straw/grain ratio for plot 163. 
37,2013 forage maize yields are unreliable due to the accidental application of herbicide to the crop in June/July 2013. 
38,"Mg applied every third year (except strip 14) harvest years 1974-2000, ie autumn 1973, 1976, 1979â€¦1994, 1997. 2001 onwards applied annually. Details from White Books, 1993-2001. Assume same pattern for earlier years (1974-1992), as details could not be found in records.  "
39,"Mg rate every third year 30kg/ha instead of 35, in harvest years 1992, 1995, 1998. "
40,"1989 Section 2 plot 3 straw yield originally missing from e-RA, shown as 0.57 in yield book. Value in Yield Book is correct. "
41,"1987 date of autumn N not in Yield Book, assumed it was the same date as P application (as in previous years)"
42,2021 Section 8 plot 15 grain yield missing.
43,"2021 beans Section 5, plot 15 had very low grain yield and was very wet, and possibly mostly made up of debris in the dry matter sample. "
44,"From 2021 no P applied to strips 11, 13 and 14, as after a review of soil P it was concluded that these strips had sufficient reserves of plant-available soil P. Shown as (P*) to indicate P no longer applied"
45,"Strip 21 also known as 2.1, 2a and 2A. Received FYM since 1885."
46,"Strip 22, originally strip 2 started in 1843, but renamed 22 in 1885 when strip 21 was started. Also known as strip 2.2, 2b and 2B. Received FYM since 1843"
