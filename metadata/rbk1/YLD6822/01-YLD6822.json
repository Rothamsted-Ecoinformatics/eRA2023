            "description": "The Broadbalk Wheat Experiment was started in autumn 1843 to investigate the effects of fertilizers containing N, P, K, Na and Mg in various combinations, and organic manure, on the yield of winter wheat grown continuously. The treatment STRIPS (3-22) extend the whole length of the field; each strip tests a different fertilizer or manure treatment. In 1926 the strips were divided into five SECTIONS (I-V), bare fallowed in sequence to control weeds. There were further divisions in 1955 making seven Sections (IA-VB). Each PLOT is a unique strip\\section combination. In 1968 the experiment was divided into ten Sections (0-9), to allow the comparison of wheat grown continuously with wheat in a three or five-year rotation. Strip 1 was added in 1968, on Sections 2-7 only. \r\nSections 0, 1, 8 and 9 remained in continuous winter wheat. In Sections 2-7 wheat was grown in rotation with other arable crops (potatoes, beans, oats or forage maize) and fallow. In 1979 Section 6 reverted to continuous wheat. Section 0 has had straw incorporated each year since 1986; straw is removed from all other sections. Section 8 has never received herbicides; it is bare fallowed every 5-8 years to control weeds. Section 6 has had restricted pesticide use since 1985 (no spring or summer fungicides). Yields from non-wheat crops are published separately. See section_names.pdf for full details of layout and the cropping plans for details of the different crop rotations. "

Since 1980 straw yield has been recorded regularly for Section 1 and the 1st wheat in rotation only each year, with some other sections in other years. In fallow years the plots were cultivated to kill weeds. No N fertilizer was applied, but FYM and PKNaMg applied as usual. Fallow (no crop) yields are shown as blank cells.  \r\nStrip 21 was also known as 2.1, 2a and 2A; strip 22 was also known as 2.2, 2b and 2B. By convention, the year is that of harvest (not sowing). "

To ensure quality control during data inputting, the data sets were typed on two separate occasions (double data entry). During the second typing (verification) the data values were compared with those typed on the earlier occasion, and any discrepancies were resolved before verification continued. This procedure also set out how to handle situations where the written records were illegible or ambiguous. This procedure avoided visual checking of data, which can be very inaccurate. Once the data were entered into e-RA, they were independently back-checked against the original data sheets. "
