        "description": "This dataset provides mean long-term yields of winter wheat (grain at 85% dry matter) from 1852-2022 in response to selected treatments on the Broadbalk \"Classical\" long-term experiment. The Figure shows the long-term trends and yields achieved under various scenarios in comparison with the original practices. The data are mean values over various numbers of years and/or cultivars; there is considerable year-to-year variability (data for individual years are available from the Broadbalk Complete Open Access dataset or e-eRAdata). Trends reflect the treatments and agronomic practices introduced on Broadbalk such as continuous wheat (solid lines) and rotations (dashed lines), old varieties until 1967 versus modern short-strawed cultivars since 1968, and the management of pests, weeds and diseases, introduced at various times since the 1920s. This new updated version of the figure includes data from 2017-2022 and a treatment of \"best continuous wheat\" as a comparison to the \"best rotational wheat\" treatment. A new rotation with two 1st wheats, using the yields after a one-year break of beans since 2018, is indicated by a break in the dashed lines, top right.\r\n\r\nThe experiment was originally set up as long strips the length of the field and weeded by hand-hoeing. That eventually became impractical and so the experiment was divided into five sections in the 1920s and regular fallowing was introduced to control weeds. The introduction of herbicides on the whole experiment (except on what is now Section 8) in 1964 removed the need for fallowing. In 1968, major changes occurred; the introduction of short-strawed varieties with greater yield potential, and the further division of sections to allow for rotations on some sections of the experiment, so allowing for the comparison of yields of wheat grown continuously or as the first wheat after a two-year break. The form of fertiliser N being tested changed and a higher rate (192 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>) was introduced. Since 1979, summer fungicides have been used, exploiting the greater grain yield potential of modern cultivars. From 1985, two further higher N rates have been tested (240 and 288 kg N ha <sup>-1</sup>). Since 2000, P has been withheld from selected plots (as plant-available P is not limiting) and split-N applications was introduced on some plots. New varieties of wheat are introduced to maintain relevance with current agricultural practice. Since 1968 there have been various crop rotations, indicated top right of figure. A new five-year rotation was introduced from 2018 with two 1st-wheats, one after a legume, the other after a non-legume (wheat>wheat>oats>wheat> beans, Sections 2, 3, 4,5 and 7).\r\n\r\nThe largest yields are from wheat in rotation rather than continuous wheat. They are usually from the first wheat crop in rotation and often from the combination of FYM + 96 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> (144 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> since 2005, plot 2.1) rather than from inorganic fertilizer alone. For continuous wheat, the best NPK treated plots yield more than either FYM alone (plot 2.2) or PKMg + 144 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> (plot 8). The largest annual wheat yields ever recorded on Broadbalk was 13.8 t ha<sup>-1</sup> in 2014 (variety Crusoe; plot 17 N1+4+1PKMg). The largest yield in the drought year of 2022 was 12.22 t ha-1 (variety Zyatt; a 2nd wheat on plot 2.1 FYM+N3), the tenth-highest yield ever recorded. Note that the best yields are not always achieved with the highest N rate (see Complete Open Access dataset). The figure shows the mean best 1st  wheat yields achieved from the NPK treatments, receiving up to a maximum of 288 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> (up to 192 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> from 1968-1984). This is always much more than the equivalent best continuous wheat NPK yield. Yields of continuous wheat given no fertilizer or manure (Nil plots 3) have remained at around 1 t ha<sup>-1</sup> in general. However, these yields dipped in the late 1910s and early 1920s due to weed infestation arising (at least in part) from a reduced labour force during and after the First World War, and have again fallen since the 1980s, possibly due to lower inputs of atmospheric N. The yields from the continuous wheat plots with (P)KMg + 144 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> have fallen also over the last few years, whereas the yields from the continuous wheat with FYM have increased, although note that this last point is the mean of only 3 years.

To control weeds, the experiment was divided into five sections in the 1920s and one section bare fallowed each year. The introduction of herbicides removed the need for fallowing. Yields of continuous wheat given no fertilizer or manure have remained at around 1 t ha-1. In 1968 a rotation was introduced on part of the experiment, so that it is now possible to compare the yields of wheat grown continuously and as the first wheat after a two-year break. Since 1979 summer fungicides have been used, which has allowed us to exploit the greater grain yield potential of modern cultivars. From 1985, two higher N rates have been tested, 240 and 288 kg N ha -1. The highest yields are now from the first wheat crop in rotation, with the greatest yields from fertilizer alone exceeding those from FYM alone, and the combination of FYM + 96 kgN ha-1 (144 kgN ha-1 since 2005) often exceeding both. The largest annual wheat yields on Broadbalk (>13 t ha-1) were recorded in 2014, following the change in variety from Hereward to Crusoe. The greatest yields were not always achieved with the highest N rate. The figure shows the mean greatest first wheat yields achieved from the NPK treatments, receiving up to a maximum of 288 kg N ha-1 (a maximum of 192 kg N ha-1 from 1968-1984). ",

        "description": "This dataset provides mean long-term yields of winter wheat (grain at 85% dry matter) from 1852-2018 in response to selected treatments on the Broadbalk \"Classical\" long-term experiment. The Figure shows the long-term trends and yields achieved under various scenarios in comparison with the original practices at the start of the experiment. The data are mean values over various numbers of years and/or cultivars; there is considerable year-to-year variability (data for individual years are available from the Broadbalk Complete Open Access dataset or e-eRAdata). Trends reflect the treatments and agronomic practices introduced on Broadbalk such as continuous wheat (solid lines) and rotations (dashed lines), old varieties until 1967 versus modern short-strawed cultivars since 1968, and the management of pests, weeds and diseases, introduced at various times since the 1920s. \r\n\r\nThis new updated version of the figure includes data from 2017 & 2018 and a treatment of \"best continuous wheat\" as a comparison to the \"best rotational wheat\" treatment - it was created for the new summary publication on Broadbalk 1968-2018, \"The Broadbalk Wheat Experiment, Rothamsted, UK: Crop yields and soil changes during the last 50 years\" (2024) Poulton et al. Advances in Agronomy.\r\n\r\nThe field experiment was originally set up as long strips the length of the field and weeded by hand-hoeing. That eventually became impractical and so the experiment was divided into five sections in the 1920s and regular fallowing was introduced to control weeds. The introduction of herbicides on the whole experiment (except on what is now Section 8) in 1964 removed the need for fallowing. In 1968, major changes occurred; the introduction of short-strawed varieties with greater yield potential, and the further division of sections to allow for rotations on some sections of the experiment, so allowing for the comparison of yields of wheat grown continuously or as the first wheat after a two-year break; the form of fertiliser N being tested changed and a higher rate (192 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>) was introduced. Other changes followed; Since 1979, summer fungicides have been used, exploiting the greater grain yield potential of modern cultivars; From 1985, two further higher N rates have been tested (240 and 288 kg N ha <sup>-1</sup>). Since 2000, P has been withheld from selected plots (as plant-available P is not limiting) and split-N applications was introduced on some plots. New varieties of wheat are introduced to maintain relevance with current agricultural practice.  \r\n\r\nSince 1968 there have been various crop rotations on five sections, indicated top right of figure, and the largest yields are from the wheat in rotation rather than continuous wheat. They are usually from the first wheat crop and often from the combination of FYM + 96 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> (144 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> since 2005, plot 2.1) rather than from inorganic fertilizer alone. For continuous wheat, the best NPK treated plots yield more than either FYM alone (plot 2.2) or PKMg + 144 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> (plot 8). The largest annual wheat yields ever recorded on Broadbalk was 13.8 t ha<sup>-1</sup> in 2014 (variety Crusoe; plot 17 N1+4+1PKMg). The largest yield in the drought year of 2022 was 12.22 t ha<sup>-1</sup> (variety Zyatt; a 2nd wheat on plot 2.1 FYM+N3), the tenth-highest yield ever recorded. Note that the best yields are not always achieved with the highest N rate. The figure shows the mean best 1st  wheat yields achieved from the NPK treatments, receiving up to a maximum of 288 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> (up to 192 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> from 1968-1984). This is always much more than the equivalent best continuous wheat NPK yield. Yields of continuous wheat given no fertilizer or manure (Nil plots 3) have remained at around 1 t ha<sup>-1</sup> in general. However, these yields dipped in the late 1910s and early 1920s due to weed infestation arising (at least in part) from a reduced labour force during and after the First World War, and have again fallen since the 1980s, possibly due to lower inputs of atmospheric N.

        "description": "This dataset consists of the relative annual frequencies of all non-crop plant species ('weeds') recorded in all eighteen plots of section 8 of the Broadbalk wheat experiment, 1991-2021. Section 8 has not received any herbicides in its history - in contrast to the other sections of Broadbalk which have received herbicides since 1964. Broadbalk section 8 is one of the few arable sites in the country where herbicides have never been applied. Consequently it is populated by a rich diversity of arable species, some very rare elsewhere in England. Broadbalk continues to act as a valuable resource for weed investigations 180 years after it was established, for example Moss _et al._ (2004).\r\n\r\nThere have been various surveys of weeds on Broadbalk wheat experiment since its conception in 1843, but not a consistent methodology in these. The first plot-by-plot surveys of weed species were done in 1869 recording the presence of species. The first phase of annual surveys was between 1933-1979 prior to the current layout of sections. The current weed survey was started on section 8 in 1991 and has continued annually ever since - although not on years when that section is in fallow: 1994, 2001, 2008, 2015, 2016 and 2022. Section 8 (called section VA 1958-1967) was created in 1968 when the experiment was divided into its present layout (Broadbalk plan today).  \r\n\r\nThe current assessment method records the presence of individual weed species in 25 random quadrats (0.1m<sup>2</sup>) per plot. The plots receive differing types and rates of fertilizer treatments and the weed species reflect these. Each year all 18 plots are surveyed meaning 450 quadrats are assessed per year, usually in June. Frequencies refer to the total number of quadrats in which a weed is recorded, the maximum being 25 per plot and 450 across all plots in the section. This method is more appropriate for detecting long-term trends in weed frequencies and population differences between plots than the earlier surveys and provides a comprehensive set of 20 years of data for weed studies.  \r\n\r\nThere have been 60 different species identified over the 30-year duration of this current survey, but many of these only occur sporadically and around 30 of these are currently recorded annually. This site also provides an invaluable reserve for seven nationally rare or uncommon species including corn cleavers (_Galium tricornutum_), corn buttercup (_Ranunculus arvensis_), shepherds needle (_Scandix pecten-veneris_) and prickly poppy (_Papaver argemone_). This is now the only location in the UK where corn cleavers is known to occur naturally. \r\n\r\nThis valuable resource, and associated data, allows the study of long-term interactions between plant species, an opportunity to test current controversies in population and community ecology such as equilibrium theories which require data on resource requirements and loss rates. The long time series enables the detection of cycles in the abundance of individual species; to determine to stability of weed communities; it  enables various weed investigations including weed population ecology; studies on the effects of fallowing on the weed seed bank; seed dormancy and persistence; agroecology and population dynamics of individual weed species. Recently, molecular approaches have been used to study the genetic diversity of weeds found on Section 8, this rare herbicide-free arable plot. On plots where inorganic nitrogen fertiliser has been applied, potential yield losses from weeds have consistently increased since 1969. This was explained by a warming climate, measured as air temperature averaged over the growing season for the weeds, and a shift towards shorter crop cultivars (Storkey et al 2021). Weeds on Broadbalk may genetically more competitive now due to selection for more competitive individuals\r\n\r\n\r\nThis dataset also provides the yields of the plots both with and without the weight of the weed seeds. The percentage of weed seeds in the total grain varies between greatly, between 1-71.8% of the total grain yield. The year 2012 was a particularly high weed year followed by 2007 and 2013.  \r\n\r\n**Herbicide Resistance Studies:** This section 8 of Broadbalk is an important source of susceptible seed of the weed _Alopecurus myosuroides_, blackgrass. It provides an excellent standard susceptible strain for use in herbicide-resistance assays, as having never received herbicides the grass-weed has never evolved herbicide resistance. See \"Herbicide resistance in _Alopecurus myosuroides_: The value of routine testing of seed samples submitted by farmers since 1985\", Cook et al. Weed Research (2023). ",

BFR infection varied a lot from year to year, possibly due to variation in winter and spring temperature and rainfall. Infection was greatest in 3rd wheats and continuous wheat, and least in 1st wheats. Fertilizer application rates influenced infection, with the lowest rates in plots where one or more nutrients was missing (plots 10 and 11). The plots treated with the most nitrogen (plots 15 and 21) had the highest BFR scores, as also reported for Broadbalk by Glynne (1969) and in dilution plating studies by Bateman and Coskun (1995) and Snyder and Nash (1968).  \r\n\r\nThis dataset was assembled by Amisha Pradhan in summer 2021 as part of the Nuffield Research Placements Summer Studentship scheme.",

As in earlier years, differential chalk applications were made to selected plots in 2008, 2014 and 2019, the amount applied depending on the soil pH.",
