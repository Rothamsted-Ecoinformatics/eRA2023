            "description": "The Broadbalk Wheat Experiment was started in 1843. Each plot (strip) tests the effects of different fertilizers and manures on the yield of winter wheat. Many treatments remained unchanged from 1852-1967. In 1968 the experiment was divided into 10 Sections, to compare continuous wheat with wheat grown in rotation with other arable crops, and new fertilizer treatments were introduced. Yields increased due to the introduction of modern cultivars, pest and disease control. Data is presented here for Section 1, which has grown wheat every year, except for fallow years to control weeds, the last in 1966. Details are given of the fertilizer treatments applied 2001-2015. For full details of the fertilizer treatments applied 1852-2000 refer to Related Documents. "

Winter wheat was grown every year, except for 2015, when the spring wheat variety Mulika was sown, as it was too wet to sow the usual winter wheat in the autumn. "
