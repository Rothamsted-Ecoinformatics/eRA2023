### Abstract
This dataset contains the annual harvested grain and straw yields and N content for each treatment plot of the Broadbalk Wheat Experiment, Section 1 (continuous wheat) 2001-2015. Also other agronomic information including sowing and harvest date, amount, type and date of application of fertilizers and manure, and wheat varieties.
### Methods
The Broadbalk Wheat Experiment was started in 1843. Each plot (strip) tests the effects of different fertilizers and manures on the yield of winter wheat. Many treatments remained unchanged from 1852-1967. In 1968 the experiment was divided into 10 Sections, to compare continuous wheat with wheat grown in rotation with other arable crops, and new fertilizer treatments were introduced. Yields increased due to the introduction of modern cultivars, pest and disease control. Data is presented here for Section 1, which has grown wheat every year, except for fallow years to control weeds, the last in 1966. Details are given of the fertilizer treatments applied 2001-2015. For full details of the fertilizer treatments applied 1852-2000 refer to Related Documents.
### Technical Info
Wheat grain and straw yields have been recorded every year since the experiment began. Straw yields are that removed by the combine harvester, they do not include the stubble or part of the chaff. Yields are expressed at 85% dry matter. Grain and straw % N content were measured by combustion analysis (LECO). Winter wheat was grown every year, except for 2015, when the spring wheat variety Mulika was sown, as it was too wet to sow the usual winter wheat in the autumn.
### Provenance
Annual yields are taken from the individual plot yields of grain and straw in the BKYIELD_R85 dataset in the e-RA database. Grain and straw N content are taken from the BKWHNUTRI dataset in the e-RA database. The Rothamsted 'Yield Books', held in the Rothamsted Library Archive, were used to check the treatments applied to the plots.
### Quality
In accordance with the Joint Code of Practice for Research at Rothamsted, data processing in e-RA follow rigorous standard operating procedures to ensure the quality and correctness of data collected in the field through to depositing in the e-RA database.  Once the data were entered into e-RA, they were independently back-checked against the original data sheets.
