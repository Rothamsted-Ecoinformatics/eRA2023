1,"Strip 21, started in 1885. Also known as strip 2.1, 2a and 2A. "
2,"Strip 22, originally strip 2 started in 1843, but renamed 22 in 1885 when strip 21 was started. Also known as strip 2.2, 2b and 2B. Received FYM since 1843."
3,"Strip 20 present in Sections I and II only, started in 1906. See experiment plan. "
4,Strip 7 1928 Section I no yield data recorded.
5,"No data in e-RA for strip 18, 1946, Section II. However Yield Books gives yield of 0.41 (grain) and 1.28 (straw) which is much less than other yields from that strip on the other sections. "
6,"No yield data strip 20 Section II, 1928-1930"
7,"Plot 9 1930, assume N applied, not included in records in White Book"
8,"No yield data Section II, 1963, strips 10, 11, 12 and 14"
9,"Section I divided into IA and IB in 1955. Section 1A continuous wheat, no fallow, with herbicides from 1957 to control weeds. Section 1B continued in rotation with fallow one year in five. "
10,Section V divided into VA and VB in autumn 1954 for a test of liming. Lime was applied to section VB in autumn 1954 and to section VA in autumn 1963.
11,"In 1963 Section VB no longer fallowed, and received herbicides as required. Section VA continued with five year wheat and fallow cycle, and no herbicides were applied.  Since 1964 herbicides were used on the whole field except Section VA (which became Section 8 after 1967)."
12,In 1937 the grain from these plots was severely damaged by rats in the barn before threshing. The grain yield was estimated from the grain-straw ratio of previous years. 
13,"No straw yield data in e-RA for Strip 14, Section III, and grain shown incorrectly as 5.84. Used value in Yield Book for 1930, grain = 3.35, straw = 7.53.  "
