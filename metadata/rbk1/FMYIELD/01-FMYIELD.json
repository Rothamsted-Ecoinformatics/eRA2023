The treatment STRIPS extend the whole length of the field; each strip tests a different fertilizer or manure treatment. In 1926 the strips were divided into five SECTIONS (I-V), bare fallowed in sequence to control weeds. There were further divisions in 1955 making seven Sections (IA-VB). Each PLOT is a unique strip\\section combination.  In 1968 the experiment was divided into ten SECTIONS (0-9), to allow the comparison of wheat grown continuously with wheat in a three or five-year rotation. Wheat is grown in rotation with other arable crops (forage maize, beans, potatoes or oats) and fallow in Sections 2-5 and 7. Wheat only is grown in the other sections.  Strip 1 was added in 1968, on Sections 2-7 only.  \r\n\r\nYields from wheat and non-wheat crops are published separately. See section_names.pdf for full details of layout and the cropping plans for details of the different crop rotations. "

To ensure quality control during data inputting, the data sets were typed on two separate occasions (double data entry). During the second typing (verification) the data values were compared with those typed on the earlier occasion, and any discrepancies were resolved before verification continued. This procedure also set out how to handle situations where the written records were illegible or ambiguous. This procedure avoided visual checking of data, which can be very inaccurate. Once the data were entered into e-RA, they were independently back-checked against the original data sheets. "
