1,Na rate to plot 12 changed from 57 to 55 in 1974. 
2,"Strip 1 FYM no longer applied from 2001, shown as (FYM), ie residual FYM. PK no longer applied  (see note 7)."

8,"2021 beans Section 5, plot 15 had very low grain yield and was very wet, and possibly mostly made up of debris in the dry matter sample. "
9,"From 2021 no P applied to strips 11, 13 and 14, as after a review of soil P it was concluded that these strips had sufficient reserves of plant-available soil P. Shown as (P*) to indicate P no longer applied"
