### Abstract
This dataset contains annual spring barley yield data for all plots of the Exhaustion Land Experiment, 1949-1975, and agronomic details including sowing dates and varieties. No yields were recorded 1940-1948.  Basal nitrogen fertilizer was applied to all plots 1940-1974; no other fertilizer or manure was applied. This phase of the experiment tests the residual effects of different fertilizers and manures applied 1856-1901.
### Methods
The experiment was established in 1856 and divided into 10 plots (1-10) in 1876, each receiving a different fertilizer or manure treatment until 1901. No fertilizer or manure was applied 1902-1939. Spring barley was grown every year from 1949 except 1967 and 1975 (bare fallow). In 1957 and 1958 some plots were used for microplot experiments; this data is not included here.
### Technical Info
Barley grain and straw yields at 85% dry matter, the straw yields do not include stubble. Ground chalk was applied as required to parts of some plots in 1954 and 1960 to ensure soil was around pH 7-8.
### Provenance
Individual plot yields were taken from Rothamsted Experimental Station Annual Reports and Yield Books.  Agronomic information (sowing dates, variety, etc) taken from Annual Reports, Yield Books, plans and descriptions in the Rothamsted Library archives. The frictionless dataset of combined yields and treatment data was compiled by June Kimori and checked by Daniel Philcox and Margaret Glendining, July 2022.
### Quality
In accordance with the Joint Code of Practice for Research at Rothamsted, data processing in e-RA follow rigorous standard operating procedures to ensure the quality and correctness of data collected in the field through to depositing in the e-RA database. To ensure quality control during data inputting, the data sets were typed on two separate occasions (double data entry). During the second typing (verification) the data values were compared with those typed on the earlier occasion, and any discrepancies were resolved before verification continued. This procedure avoided visual checking of data, which can be very inaccurate.
