               Exhaustion Land (R/EX/4) 

******************************************************************************************




DESCRIPTION
    The Exhaustion Land experiment has had several distinct phases since it started in 1856. Today, it is used to study the residual effects of fertilizers and manures applied from 1856-1901 and additional phosphate applied since 1986, on the yield of cereals. A test of potassium was introduced in 2007. Treatments have been managed so that the soils now have a wide range of plant available P and K.  From 1856-1875 wheat was grown, then potatoes (1876-1901) with a range of fertilizer treatments. No fertilizer or manure was applied 1902-1939; this phase of the experiment tests the residual effects of the fertilizers and manures applied 1856-1901 (Phase I). Cereals, mainly spring barley, were grown every year, except 1905-1911 when continuous red clover was grown on some plots. In 1940 fertilizer N was applied to all plots, and spring barley grown. This demonstrated the residual value of the P and K from the first period of the experiment.
    To test the residual effects of mineral fertilizer and manures applied 1876-1901 and of additional phosphate applied since 1986, on the yield of spring barley (up to 1991) and winter wheat. A test of potassium was introduced in 2007. Soils now have a range of plant available P and K.
