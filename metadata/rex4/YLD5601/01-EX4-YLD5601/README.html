<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>This dataset contains crop yield data from Phase 1 of the Exhaustion Land long-term experiment, 1856-1901. Details of the fertilizer and manure treatments, sowing and harvest dates are also included. Winter wheat was grown each year from 1856-1874. The experiment was fallowed in 1875, then potatoes were grown each year from 1876-1901. Potato tuber % dry matter and % N content are also included.</p>
<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>The experiment was established in 1856, with four fertilizer and manure treatments, including two nil plots. In 1876 the five plots were divided into 10, and some new fertilizer and manure treatments added. Potatoes were grown each year from 1876-1901. The whole experiment was fallowed (no crop grown) in 1872 and 1875. Yields are given for every year based on the 10 plots present from 1876, thus for 1856-1874 yields from plots 1 and 2 are the same, yields for plots 3 and 4  are the same, etc.</p>
<h3>Technical Info</h3>
<p>Crop yields were recorded every year. Wheat grain and straw yields are at field moisture content, approximately 85% dry matter. Potato tuber yields are shown for three categories of tuber: 'good', 'small' and 'diseased'. 'Good' is defined as being retained by a 28.6mm sieve; 'small' pass through this sieve.  Tuber total yield is for 'good' plus 'small' plus 'diseased' tubes. Tuber yield at 100% dry matter was calculated from 'good' tuber % dry matter at harvest and total tuber yield. Tuber N content was calculated from %N content of the 'good' tubers and total tuber yield. The potato tops were not weighed but left on the plots  and ploughed in. Wheat straw yields do not include the stubble.  Before the experiment started, unfertilized wheat was grown 1850-1855.</p>
<h3>Provenance</h3>
<p>Annual yields were transcribed from original data sheets held in the Rothamsted paper archive and from the 'Memoranda of the Field and Other Experiments', 1901. Details of treatments were taken from the 'Memoranda of the Field and Other Experiments' 1901, and other publications.</p>
<h3>Quality</h3>
<p>In accordance with the Joint Code of Practice for Research at Rothamsted, data processing in e-RA follow rigorous standard operating procedures to ensure the quality and correctness of data collected in the field through to depositing in the e-RA database. To ensure quality control during data inputting, the data sets were typed on two separate occasions (double data entry). During the second typing (verification) the data values were compared with those typed on the earlier occasion, and any discrepancies were resolved before verification continued.  This procedure avoided visual checking of data, which can be very inaccurate.</p>
