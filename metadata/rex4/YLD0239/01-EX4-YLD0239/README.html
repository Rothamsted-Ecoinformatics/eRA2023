<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>This dataset contains the annual yield data for Phase II of all plots of the Exhaustion Land Experiment 1902-1922 and 1935.  No yields were recorded 1923-1939, except in 1935. Also sowing dates, varieties and hectolitre weights.</p>
<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>The experiment was established in 1856, and divided into 10 plots (1-10) in 1876, given various fertilizer and manure treatments each year until 1901. No fertilizer or manure was applied 1902-1939; this phase of the experiment tests the residual effects of the fertilizers and manures applied 1856-1901 (Phase I). Cereals, mainly spring barley, were grown every year, except 1905-1911 when continuous red clover was grown on some plots.</p>
<h3>Technical Info</h3>
<p>Crop yields were recorded each year 1902-1922 and 1935, except 1920 when the whole experiment was bare fallowed to control weeds. Cereal grain and straw yields are at 85% dry matter. Cereal straw yields do not include the stubble. Grain hectolitre weights (kg grain per 100 litres) are calculated from bushel weights, assuming 1 bushel = 36.369 litres. Plots 5-10 grew continuous red clover from 1905-1911, yield is total forage dry matter yield for two cuts (one cut only in 1909).</p>
<h3>Provenance</h3>
<p>Annual yields were transcribed from original data sheets held in the Rothamsted paper archive and from the Yields of the Field Experiments and Rothamsted Annual Reports. Details of treatments were taken from the Rothamsted Annual Reports and other publications. The frictionless dataset of combined yields and treatment data was compiled by June Kimori and checked by Daniel Philcox and Margaret Glendining, July 2022.</p>
<h3>Quality</h3>
<p>In accordance with the Joint Code of Practice for Research at Rothamsted, data processing in e-RA follow rigorous standard operating procedures to ensure the quality and correctness of data collected in the field through to depositing in the e-RA database. To ensure quality control during data inputting, the data sets were typed on two separate occasions (double data entry). During the second typing (verification) the data values were compared with those typed on the earlier occasion, and any discrepancies were resolved before verification continued. This procedure avoided visual checking of data, which can be very inaccurate.</p>
