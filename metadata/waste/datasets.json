The site was in long-term arable cropping since at least 1881 before the experiment started (Lawes and Gilbert, 1885). Originally there were 12 blocks, but blocks 5-12 were discontinued from 1968 and only blocks 1-4 were continued.

BFR infection varied a lot from year to year, possibly due to variation in winter and spring temperature and rainfall. Infection was greatest in 3rd wheats and continuous wheat, and least in 1st wheats. Fertilizer application rates influenced infection, with the lowest rates in plots where one or more nutrients was missing (plots 10 and 11). The plots treated with the most nitrogen (plots 15 and 21) had the highest BFR scores, as also reported for Broadbalk by Glynne (1969) and in dilution plating studies by Bateman and Coskun (1995) and Snyder and Nash (1968).  \r\n\r\nThis dataset was assembled by Amisha Pradhan in summer 2021 as part of the Nuffield Research Placements Summer Studentship scheme.
