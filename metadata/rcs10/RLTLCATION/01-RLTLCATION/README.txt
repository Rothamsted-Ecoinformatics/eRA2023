### Abstract
The experiment tests the effects of different amounts of lime (and thus soil pH), P and K on a sequence of arable crops, on a silty clay loam soil at Rothamsted Experimental Farm, Harpenden, from 1962-1996. Archived topsoil samples from six years between 1964 and 1989  were re-analysed in 2019 for a range of soil exchangeable cations, by extraction with ammonium nitrate. There was a parallel experiment at Woburn Experimental Farm. 

This experiment was under grass from 1997-2019 and no treatments were applied. In April 2019 the experiment was revived, and is currently being used to investigate the effect of different lime, P and Zn treatments on macro and micro nutrient uptake of wheat varieties. For more details contact Dr SM Haefele. 
This work was partially funded by the BBSRC through the Soil to Nutrition programme BBS/E/C/00010310.
### Methods
Period 1 (1962-1980): four lime levels with and without fertilizer P and K. Period 2 (1981-1996): four lime levels with four P levels. 2 replicates (blocks). 
 -  Topsoil (0-18 or 0-23cm) sampled in 1964, 1967, 1974, 1979, 1983 and 1989
 - 12-20 soil cores taken from the central area of each plot and combined to make one sample
 - Soil samples taken in autumn, after harvest and before ploughing for the next crop
 - Archived air-dried sieved (<2mm) soils re-analysed in 2019. 
 - Exchangeable cations Al, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na and Zn, mg/kg dry soil
 - Measured by extraction with 1 M ammonium nitrate. 
 - Cations detected by ICP-OES (Inductively Coupled Plasma - Optical Emission Spectrometer).
 - Negative values shown as zero.
### Technical Info

### Other
**Detection limits (DL) of the ICP-OES.** 
These values provide an indication of the lower values for detection by the ICP-OES. DL (mg/kg dry soil) is calculated as 3x standard deviation of blanks.
