### Abstract
The experiment tests the effects of different amounts of lime (and thus soil pH), P and K on a sequence of arable crops, on a silty clay loam soil at Rothamsted Experimental Farm, from 1962-1996. Mg, Mn and S were tested on split plots at different times. Target soil pH was 4.5, 5.5, 6.5 and 7.5. This dataset contains soil pH, Olsen P and exchangeable cations (Ca, K, Mg and Na, ammonium acetate method), on soil sampled several times between 1962 and 1996. There is also a baseline sampling before the experiment was established. There was a parallel experiment at Woburn Experimental Farm.  

The experiment was under grass from 1997-2019 and no treatments were applied. In April 2019 the experiment was revived, and is currently being used to investigate the effect of different lime, P and Zn treatments on macro and micro nutrient uptake of wheat varieties. For more details contact Dr SM Haefele.
### Methods
Period 1 (1962-1980): four lime levels with and without fertilizer P and K. Magnesium was tested on split plots 1974-1978. Period 2 (1981-1996): four lime levels with four P levels. Manganese was tested on split plots 1987-1990; Sulphur was tested on split plots 1991-1996. 2 replicates. 

- **Soil pH** measured in water: 1:2.5 soil: water suspension using a standard electrode and pH meter.
- **Olsen P** (plant-available soil P) soil extracted with a solution of 0.5 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, buffered at pH8.5, after the method of Olsen et al, 1954. Shown as mg PO<sub>4</sub>-P/kg dry soil. 
- **Exchangeable cations** measured in sieved (<2mm) air-dry soil leached with 1 M ammonium acetate, adjusted to pH 7. Leachates analysed by emission or atomic absorption flame spectrophotometry.  Since 1989, the extracts have been analysed by ICP-OES (Inductively Coupled Plasma - Optical Emission Spectrometer).
### Technical Info
Air-dried soil, sieved (<2mm). Topsoil (usually 0-23cm) and some sub-soil measurements. For topsoil 12-20 cores were taken from the central area of each plot and combined to make one sample. For subsoil, generally 5-6 cores were taken and combined. Baseline soil pH measurements were taken in February 1962, before the first lime application. Soil samples were generally taken in the autumn, after the current crop was harvested and before the soil was ploughed for the next harvest year, so that the soil properties could be related to the treatments applied in the previous harvest year. The soil was analysed shortly after sampling.

### Provenance
Information is taken from original raw data sheets and analysis files, held in the archives at Rothamsted Research. The data is derived from measurements made by the Analytical Chemistry Unit, Rothamsted Research, Harpenden.
### Quality
In accordance with the Joint Code of Practice for Research at Rothamsted, data processing in e-RA follow rigorous standard operating procedures to ensure the quality and correctness of data collected in the field through to depositing in the e-RA database. To ensure quality control during data inputting, the data sets were typed on two separate occasions (double data entry). During the second typing (verification) the data values were compared with those typed on the earlier occasion, and any discrepancies were resolved before verification continued. This procedure also set out how to handle situations where the written records were illegible or ambiguous. This procedure avoided visual checking of data, which can be very inaccurate.
The Analytical Chemistry Unit follows the Joint Code of Practice (JCoPR) and participates in European Quality Assurance programmes. All performance is strictly monitored using certified external standards alongside in-house standard materials. Standards and check samples are monitored and recorded.

###soil_data

####Soil data

The main data table containing soil chemical data for all plots and all treatments, 1962-1996. Includes soil pH, Olsen P and exchangeable Ca, K, Mg, Na and Mn (ammonium acetate method). Soil not measured every year, last sample taken in 1994. Baseline soil pH measurements taken in February 1962, before lime treatments applied. Soil samples were generally taken in the autumn, after the current crop was harvested and before the soil was ploughed for the next harvest year, so that the soil properties could be related to the treatments applied in the previous harvest year.  The soil was analysed shortly after sampling. Also includes lime (chalk) and fertilizer treatments.

|sample_date|Date when soil sampled|date|YYYY-MM-DD|[https://schema.org/Date](https://schema.org/Date)|Date when soil sampled. Not sampled every year. Baseline soil sampled in February 1962, prior to treatments. Soil samples were generally taken in the autumn, after the current crop was harvested and before the soil was ploughed for the next harvest year, so that the soil properties could be related to the treatments applied in that harvest year.|
