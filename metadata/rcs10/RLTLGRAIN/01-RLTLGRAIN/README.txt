### Abstract
The experiment tests the effects of four different amounts of lime (creating a soil pH range for approximately 4.5 to 7.5) with and without fertilizer P, on the grain mineral compostion of three arable crops. The site is a silty clay loam soil at Rothamsted Experimental Farm, from 1962-1996. There was a parallel experiment on a sandy loam soil at Woburn Experimental Farm.
### Methods
Grain mineral composition was determined, in 2019 and 2020, on archived ground samples grown in 1978 (barley), 1981 (oats) and 1995 (wheat). Macro-nutrients (Ca, K, Mg, Na, P, S) and Al, Fe and Ti were determined by open tube digestion with HNO<sub>3</sub>/HClO<sub>4</sub> and measured with ICP-OES. Micro-nutrients and trace elements (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn) were determined with microwave digestion with HNO<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, then measured with ICP-MS.
### Provenance
The original archived grain samples were stored in the Rothamsted Sample Archive. The chemical analysis was carried out in the Analytical Unit of Rothamsted Research in 2019 and 2020.
