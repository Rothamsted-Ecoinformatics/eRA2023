The ab treatment plots were unlimed between 1965 - 1975 plot 12. Plot 15ab was limed. These plots correspond to the earlier limed plots (not for plot 12 which was all unlimed). In 1976 the ab plots were divided into a and b plots to maintain soil pH as per a and b treatment factor levels.,1965-1975,pH exposure,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/PECO_0007171,ab,0,t CaCO3 ha-1 ,applied as required to achieve desired soil pH,Ground limestone/chalk,http://aims.fao.org/aos/agrovoc/c_4342
