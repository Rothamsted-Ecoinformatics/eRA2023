1,All plots: No second cut in 2003
2,"Plot 2: In 1996 plots 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d (a long-term nil treatment) was split into plots 2-1a & 2-2a, 2-1b & 2-2b, 2-1c & 2-2c, and 2-1d & 2-2d respectively, with plots 2-1a-d receiving K fertilizer only."
3,"Plot 7: In 2013 plots 7a, 7b, 7c, 7d split into plots 7-1a & 7-2a, 7-1b & 7-2b, 7-1c & 7-2c, and 7-1d & 7-2d respectively, with no fertilizer P applied to plots 7-1a-d, to investigate effects of withholding P."
4,"Plot 9: In 1990 plots 9a, 9b, 9c, 9d split into plots 9-1a & 9-2a, 9-1b & 9-2b, 9-1c & 9-2c, and 9-1d & 9-2d respectively, with nitrogen fertilizer no longer applied to plots 9-1a-d, to investigate effects of withholding N"
5,"Plot 14: In 1990 plots 14a, 14b, 14c and 14d split into plots 14-1a & 14-2a, 14-1b & 14-2b, 14-1c & 14-2c and 14-1d & 14-2d respectively, with nitrogen fertilizer no longer applied to plots 14-1a-d, , to investigate effects of withholding N."
6,"Plots 12 & 13: Plots 12ab, 12cd and 13 yield data missing 1974 second cut"
7,"P plots: In 2017,  the P rate was reduced from 35 to 17 kg P ha-1 yr-1"
8,"Plots 12 & 15: Plots 12 and 15 were not divided into a, b, c and d liming treatments until 1976, so combined yields are shown for 12ab and 12cd (neither of which received lime), 15ab (limed) and 15cd (unlimed), 1965-1975, cuts 1 and 2. "
9,"Plot 13: In 1995 plots 13a, 13b, 13c and 13d were split into plots 13-1a & 13-2a, 13-1b & 13-2b, 13-1c & 13-2c and 13-1d & 13-2d respectively. Manures then witheld from 13-1 plots. Last FYM applied to plots 13-1 in 1993. Last FM to 13-1 applied in error (Dec 1994) for the 1995 harvest. For 13-2 plots FM replaced by PM in 2003, PM first applied in 2003.  Last FYM applied to plots 13-1a-d in 1993, last FM to plot 13-1 in 1995 (error). First PM to 13-2 in 2003."
10,"Plot 15: Since 2013 plot 15 has also received N*3 (previously PKNaMg but no N)   to provide a comparison with plot 11, which receives the same rate of N as ammonium sulphate."
11,"Plots 18, 19, 20: Plots 18-2, 19-1,2,3 and 20-1,2,3 not included in the liming scheme in 1965"
12,Plot 12: No ground chalk applied to plot 12ab or plots 12cd 1888-1975. In 1976 the ab plots were divided into a and b plots to maintain soil pH as per a and b treatment factor levels and the cd plots were divided into c and d plots to maintain soil pH as per c and d treatment factor levels. 
13,"Plot 20: Plot 20 receives 15 kg P in years when no farmyard manure is applied instead of the 17 kg P which other plots receive, and 45 kg K instead of 225 kg K"
14,Plot 9: Plot 9-1 previously received N before split in 1990 indicated as (N)
15,Plot 14: Plot 14-1 previously received N before split in 1990 indicated as (N*2)
16,Plot 6: No sub-plots c and d on plot 6 as these are microplots. No yields taken between 1965-1971 inclusive as were used as microplots for other experiments then.
17,Plot 6: Start and end of cuts dates missing plot 6 a and b 1972-1975
