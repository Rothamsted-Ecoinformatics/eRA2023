1,"In 1903 plots 1-13 (except 5-1, 5-2, 6 and 12) and 16 were divided into two and the effects of lime were tested (L, limed vs U, unlimed)"
2,"In 1920, these three plots (14, 15 and 17) were divided into two and the effects of lime were tested (L, limed vs U, unlimed); until 1919 both L and U plots were unlimed"
3,"In 1920, these three plots (18, 19 and 20) were divided into three subplots to test three different lime rates ( U unlimed, HL high limed, LL low limed); until 1919 both HL and LL plots as well as U plots were unlimed"
4,"Farmyard manure (FYM), was introduced on these three plots (13, 19 and 20) in 1905, then applied every four years (alternately with FM in plot 13)"
5,Fishmeal (FM) was introduced  on plot 13 in 1907 then applied once every four years (alternately with FYM)
6,"1960-1964; since 1960 yields are estimated immediately from strips cut with a forage harvester and not left to dry in field therefore there are no start_cart and end_cart dates (prior to this, 1903-1959, hay was left to dry in field and later carted and weighed);  a correction factor is used for post-1960 data for cut 1 to give yield values equivalent to pre-1960 values. The remainder of the plot is mown and made into hay in the usual way, continuing earlier management and ensuring the return of seed."
7,"A second cut was not taken every year, and not from every plot each year, if there was insufficient herbage to sample - no second cut always taken 1903, 1904, 1906-1914, 1916, 1917, 1921, 1924, 1933, 1934, 1943, 1949"
8,"The second cut was often taken from the whole plot, not the L and U halves, years 1903-1917, except 1915"
9,"The first cut yields were on rare occasions of the whole plot, not the L and U halves (1905-1908, plots 1, 4, 9 and 10)"
