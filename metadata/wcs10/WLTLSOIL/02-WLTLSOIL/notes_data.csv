1,"Baseline pH values, before experiment started, sampled 2 March 1962. "
2,"Date of soil sampling recorded as October, exact date not known, assumed to be the 15th. "
3,"Date of soil sampling recorded as September, exact date not known, assumed to be the 15th. "
4,"Soil sampled in autumn 1974, after harvesting the potatoes (30th September 1974), exact date not given (Bolton, 1977a)"
5,"Exact date of soil sampling not known, recorded as August 1979.  "
6,"Exact date of soil sampling not known, but before October 1981"
7,"Exact date of soil sampling not known, but before August 1989"
8,"Exact date of soil sampling not known, recorded as January/February 1994. Crop failed. Sub-soil sampled from a few plots only. Exchangeable sodium values omitted as blanks were so high many values were negative. Exchangeable K blank value unusually high (17.5) but has not been subtracted from these values. "
9,"No Olsen P value for plot 50. Data sheet suggests there was a value, but this is an error, as only nil and PK were sampled in 1972. Updated 02/01/2024"
10,"Exchangeabe calcium not included in 1973, as possible errors in the data. "
11,"Soil analysis from whole plots only, not sub-plots"
12,Olsen P values in 1982 not included as possible errors in the data. Updated 02/01/2024
