  <h3>Information about the Rothamsted Sample Archive (RSA)</h3>


  <p> From 1843, Lawes and  Gilbert retained samples of crops (grain, straw, herbage), soils, fertilizers
    &amp; manures applied to what became the &lsquo;Classicals&rsquo; or Rothamsted Long-Term Experiments (RLTEs).
    Successive generations of scientists at Rothamsted continued to add to the collection providing, in many cases, an
    unbroken record of samples pertaining to the RLTES. Today, there are over 300,000 samples, with around 1,200 crop
    and 200 soil samples being added each year. </p>
  <p> This unique resource is of immense value and has been used extensively by Rothamsted staff, and scientists throughout the world. The opportunities provided by modern techniques to analyse these historic
    archived materials, provide insights into changes over the last 180 years (2023), and  knowledge for future
    agronomic and ecological developments. No other long-term experiments have such an archive.<br />
  </p>
  <p>The samples were originally held in what is now called the &lsquo;Old Sample House&rsquo; and then in a brick barn behind the Manor.
    It was moved to a new bespoke storage facility in 2009, with room for a furtehr 30 years of samples.</p>

  <h4>The samples</h4>
  <p>Plant samples are oven-dried grain, straw &amp; herbage as well as finely ground material from other crops. Soil samples, from the top soil (generally 0-23cm) and some from sub-soils &gt; 200cm, are air dried. These soil samples are stored as sieved (6.35mm or 2mm) or finely ground samples. There are alo dried samples of organic manures and fertilisers that were applied to the field experiments.</p>
  <p>The samples are stored in a sealed glass bottles or jars, airtight tins, glass vials or card boxes,
    each with a unique label and identification number. Each shelf has a unique identifier and sample locations are
    recorded in the archive database. The majority of samples are from the Classicals and other LTEs from Rothamsted, Woburn and Brooms Barn. In addition, several thousand soil samples collected from around the worl in the 1920-1950 are also stored.</p>
  </p>
  <h4>Use of the samples</h4>
  <p>Initially, samples were analysed at the time for their nutrient content, including - N, C, P, K, Na, Mg etc, but with the
    development of successive new analytical techniques the samples can be used for many other studies, both envirnomental effects and farm management procedures. For instacne, detecting changes
    in atmospheric inputs, the development of fungicide/herbicide resistance, effects on plant pathogen populations,
    carbon modelling and microplastics in sewage sludge (see Case Studies).</p>
  </p>
  <h4>Access &amp; Collaboration</h4>
  <p>The use of the samples in collaborative research is actively encouraged. To request access to the samples, contact
    the Sample Archive Manager or the e-RA data curators (see below), ideally via a Rothamsted Collaborator. Complete
    this online request here - '<a href="Sample_Request_Form_2023.docx" target="_blank">Sample Request Form
      2023</a>&rsquo;.    Completion of this form is not a guarantee that the request will be granted, as the resource is finite, but requests
    will be carefully considered. </p>

  <h3>Case Studies</h3>
  <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Park Grass soil &amp; herbage samples</strong> i<strong>n response to changing atmospheric inputs</strong>. Park Grass soil &amp; hay smpaels were used in an assessment of the impact of changing SO2 on S cycling in the plant-soil system. While concentrations of S in herbage were  positively correlated with annual SO2   emissions  (Figure 15), the trend in the stable S isotope  ratio, δ34S, was negatively correlated with SO2  emissions, reflecting the more negative δ34S  values associated with anthropogenic S sources  (Zhao et al., 1998). Calculations suggest that  up to 50% of the herbage S uptake came from  anthropogenic sources at the peak of SO2  emissions in 1970. Sulphur dioxide (SO2  ) was an important  atmospheric pollutant in the UK for much  of the 20th century, but one that supplied  much of agriculture&rsquo;s sulphur needs. Inputs  have declined markedly since the 1970s. Zhao, F. J. , Spiro, B. , Poulton, P. R. and Mcgrath, S. P. (1998) <strong>&quot;Use of sulfur isotope ratios to determine anthropogenic sulfur signals in a grassland ecosystem&quot;</strong>, <em>Environmental Science and Technology</em>, <strong>32</strong>, (15), 2288-2291 <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/es980157f" title="DOI URL">https://doi.org/10.1021/es980157f</a>  </li>
  </ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Hoosfield Spring Barley samples and evolution of fungicide resistance</strong>.  Pyrosequencing of this DNA was used  to examine the development of resistance  to triazole fungicides in the barley pathogen  Rhynchosporium commune (leaf blotch  fungus) conferred by the presence of CYP51A,  a paralogue of the target site encoding gene  CYP51 (Hawkins et al., 2014). Spring barley  has been grown since 1852 on Hoosfield, and  R. commune DNA was successfully amplified  from the archived barley samples collected in  33 separate years between 1892 and 2012.  The pyrosequencing assay revealed that, for  most of the 20th century, the majority of the  R. commune population on Hoosfield lacked  the azole fungicide resistance conferring gene,  but in 1985, following the introduction of azole  fungicides in the UK, levels rapidly increased  and subsequently the majority of the  R. commune population possessed the  resistance gene. Hawkins, N. J. , Cools, H. J. , Sierotzki, H. , Shaw, M. W. , Knogge, W. , Kelly, S. L. , Kelly, D. E. and Fraaije, B. A. (2014) &quot;<strong>Paralog Re-Emergence: A Novel, Historically Contingent Mechanism in the Evolution of Antimicrobial Resistance</strong>&quot;, <em>Molecular Biology and Evolution</em>, <strong>31</strong>, 1793-1802. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msu134" data-google-interstitial="false">https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msu134</a> </li>
    
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Broadbalk and other LTEs soils and development of the RothC model</strong>. Data from the analyses of soils for their organic  carbon and 14C content was used to develop  and validate RothC, a computer model that  simulates the turnover of soil organic matter,  a key component of soil quality (Jenkinson,  1990). RothC is widely used by researchers  worldwide and is now linked to the global  climate model developed by the Hadley Centre. Jenkinson, D. S. (1990) &quot;<strong>The turnover of organic carbon and nitrogen in soil</strong>&quot;, <em>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Series B</em>, <strong>329</strong>, 361-368. <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.1990.0177">https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.1990.0177</a></li>
  </ul>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Broadbalk and other LTEs soils and development of the RothC model</strong>. Scientists at Southampton Oceanography  Centre analysed samples of herbage from the  Park Grass experiment over a 50-year period  to measure concentrations of plutonium  and uranium. They were able to detect the  effects of, and distinguish between, nuclear  bomb tests carried out by the US, USSR,  UK and France, and show that plutonium  contamination from weapons testing in  the Nevada Desert in 1952/3 reached  Northern Europe (Warneke et al., 2002). Such  measurements have only become possible  in recent years with the development of  more sophisticated analytical techniques. Warneke, T. , Croudace, I. W. , Warwick, P. E. and Taylor, R. N.
