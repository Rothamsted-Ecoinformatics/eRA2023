  <h3>Current PhD Project: Evolution of Eyespot resistance, using Broadbalk and Hoosfield archived grain and straw samples</h3>
  <p>
    The Rothamsted Sample Archive is the source of material for this project investigating  eyespot disease outbreaks. Eyespot poses a significant  threat to cereal crops, including wheat and barley, with implications for both  UK and global food security. Characterized by lens-shaped lesions on stems,  this disease hinders water and nutrient flow in plants, potentially resulting in crop  lodging. The overarching goal of the PhD project is to enhance our  understanding of the two closely related fungal species responsible, <em>Oculimacula acuformis</em> and <em>O.  yallundae</em>, contributing to improved disease control with reduced inputs,  both in the UK and globally. Fareed, a Rothamsted PhD  student, is utilizing the Rothamsted Sample Archive to apply modern molecular  techniques to archived wheat and barley samples. This unique resource  allows  Fareed to look back in time nearly 200 years to explore  the population dynamics <em>O. acuformis</em> and <em>O.  yallundae</em>, with the resulting data promising valuable insights into  the changing nature of eyespot disease over time. This project is under the supervision of Dr. Kevin King and Prof. Jon West.</p>

  <h3 data-test="article-title" data-article-title="">Agricultural fertilisers contribute substantially to microplastic concentrations in UK soils </h3>
<p>
  Broadbalk soils provided a historical time series to examine changes to microplastic concentrations in agricultural soils over time. Microplastic particles are intentionally added to the coating surrounding the fertiliser granules and this forms a barrier that ensures that the nutrients are released more slowly. Microplastics were stained with Nile Red and quantified using fluorescence microscopy. This study demonstrated that microplastic concentrations increased at higher rates in soils that are amended with either organic or inorganic fertiliser between 1966 and 2022, suggesting that agricultural fertilisers are an important contributor to microplastic concentrations in agricultural soils over time.  Between 1997 and 2005 microplastic increases of up to 350% were found on experimental plots treated with commercial fertilizers. On nil plots there were also seen to be a significant presence of microplastics - some microplastics are  deposited from farm machinery, may be carried in rain or  be wind-blown onto fields. <em>&quot;Agricultural fertilisers contribute substantially to microplastic concentrations in UK soils&quot;</em>,

    <h3>Park Grass soil &amp; herbage samples in response to changing atmospheric inputs. </h3>
  <p>
    Park Grass soil &amp; hay samples were used in an assessment of the impact of changing SO<sub>2</sub> on S
    cycling
    in
    the plant-soil system. While concentrations of S in herbage were positively correlated with annual
    SO<sub>2</sub>
    emissions, the trend in the stable Delta<sup>34</sup>S isotope ratio was negatively correlated with
    SO<sub>2</sub>
    emissions, reflecting the more negative Delta<sup>34</sup>S values associated with anthropogenic S sources
    (Zhao
    et
    al., 1998). Calculations suggest that up to 50% of the herbage S uptake came from anthropogenic sources at
    the
    peak of
    SO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 1970. Sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub> ) was an important atmospheric pollutant
    in the
    UK
    for much of the 20th century, but one that supplied much of agriculture&rsquo;s sulphur needs. Inputs have
    declined
    markedly since the 1970s, due to decreasing emissions from power stations. Zhao, F. J. , Spiro, B. , Poulton, P. R. and McGrath, S. P. (1998) <em>&quot;Use

  <h3>Hoosfield Spring Barley samples and evolution of fungicide resistance </h3>
  <p>
    Pyrosequencing of  DNA was used to examine the development of resistance to triazole fungicides in the
    barley
    pathogen <em>Rhynchosporium commune</em> (leaf blotch fungus) conferred by the presence of CYP51A, a paralogue of the
    target
    site encoding gene CYP51 (Hawkins et al., 2014). Spring barley has been grown since 1852 on Hoosfield, and
    <em>R.
    commune</em> DNA was successfully amplified from the archived barley samples collected in 33 separate years
    between
    1892
    and 2012. The pyrosequencing assay revealed that, for most of the 20th century, the majority of the <em>R.
    commune</em> population on Hoosfield lacked the azole fungicide resistance conferring gene, but in 1985, following the
    introduction of azole fungicides in the UK, levels rapidly increased and subsequently the majority of the <em>R.
    commune</em> population possessed the resistance gene. Hawkins, N. J. , Cools, H. J. , Sierotzki, H. , Shaw, M. W. ,

  <h3>Broadbalk, Hoosfield and other LTEs soils and development of the RothC model</h3>
  <p>
    Data from the analyses of soils for their organic carbon and 14C content was used to develop and validate
    RothC, a
    computer model that simulates the turnover of soil organic matter, a key component of soil quality
    (Jenkinson,
    1990). RothC is widely used by researchers worldwide and is now linked to the global climate model developed
    by
    the
    Hadley Centre. Jenkinson, D. S. (1990) <em>&quot;The turnover of organic carbon and nitrogen in

  <h3>Park Grass herbage and detection of radiation from nuclear bomb tests </h3>
  <p>
    Scientists at Southampton Oceanography Centre analysed samples of herbage from the Park Grass experiment
    over a
    50-year period to measure concentrations of plutonium and uranium. They were able to detect the effects of,
    and
    distinguish between, nuclear bomb tests carried out by the US, USSR, UK and France, and show that plutonium
    contamination from weapons testing in the Nevada Desert in 1952/3 reached Northern Europe (Warneke et al.,
    2002).
    Such measurements have only become possible in recent years with the development of more sophisticated
    analytical
    techniques. Warneke, T. , Croudace, I. W. , Warwick, P. E. and Taylor, R. N. (2002) <em>&quot;A new

    <h3>Long-term removal of wheat straw decreases soil amorphous silica </h3>
  <p>
    Archived samples from several long-term experiments at Rothamsted showed that export of wheat straw  leads to a decrease in bioavailable Si. In the Broadbalk  experiment, a decrease over time in amorphous Si in the topsoil samples showed that cropping and exports of straw leads to  depletion of soil phytoliths. A decrease in Si concentration in straw samples  was observed between 1883 and 1944. From 1944 to the present, Si concentration  increased irregularly in the straw, probably as the result of liming, which  enhanced the dissolution of the remaining phytoliths through increasing pH. In  the reforested Geescroft field the higher phytolith concentration in the modern  topsoil samples is in good agreement with a re-building of phytolith storage from  litter input in an acidic environment.

    <h3>Broadbalk wheat grain and decreasing mineral density since 1843</h3>
  <p>
    Wheat is an important source of minerals such as iron, zinc, copper and magnesium in the UK diet. The mineral concentration of archived wheat grain and soil samples from the Broadbalk Wheat Experiment  was determined and trends over time examined in relation to cultivar, yield, and harvest index. The concentrations of zinc, iron, copper and magnesium remained stable between 1845 and the mid 1960s, but since then have decreased significantly. which coincided with the introduction of semi-dwarf, high-yielding cultivars. In comparison, the concentrations in soil have either increased or remained stable. Similarly decreasing trends were observed in different treatments receiving no fertilizers, inorganic fertilizers or organic manure. Multiple regression analysis showed that both increasing yield and harvest index were highly significant factors that explained the downward trend in grain mineral concentration .

  <h3>Hoosfield potatoes and the causal agent of potato blight, <em>Phytopthora infestans</em></h3>
  <p>
    Late blight remained a significant disease for potato growers in Europe long after the famine of the 1840s. Long-term soil fertility experiments were conducted on potato between 1876 and 1901 in Rothamsted to investigate effects of combinations of organic manures and mineral fertilizers on disease and yield (Gilbert, J.H. 1888). This report identifies for the first time the same Ia mtDNA haplotype of <em>Phytopthora infestans</em> in three diseased tubers from 1877 from the long-term Rothamsted trials, thus providing the earliest evidence of the presence of the founder Ia mtDNA haplotype of <em>P. infestans</em> in potato tubers in England. Soil amendments had a significant impact on disease and yield. The level of pathogen DNA was greatest in tubers from highest yielding plots that received combinations of inorganic nitrogenous and mineral fertilizers and least in tubers from plots with organic farmyard manures or non-nitrogenous mineral fertilizers. The same strain of P. infestans had survived between the 1840s and the 1870s between seasons on the potato tubers. Ristiano, J.B., Hu, C.H. &amp; Fitt, B.D.L..
