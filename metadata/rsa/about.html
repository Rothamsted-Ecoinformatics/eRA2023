  <h3>Overview of the Rothamsted Sample Archive (RSA) and Access to Samples</h3>
  <p>From  the very outset in 1843, Lawes and Gilbert retained samples of crops (grain,  straw, herbage) and soils from  what later became known as the &lsquo;Classical&rsquo; experiments at Rothamsted. The samples had been taken for  nutrient analysis at that time. Following analysis, they stored the samples principally, we  assume, in case any of the analyses needed to be repeated. It was, thus,  serendipity that started the sample archive but within a few years Lawes and  Gilbert realised that it had potential longer-term value to them and to future  generations. Their understanding of the value of the stored samples is  illustrated by the following quote from a paper that they published in 1864 &nbsp;&ldquo;if our knowledge of the chemistry of  soils should progress as rapidly as it has in the last twenty years, the  analysis of a soil will ere long become much more significant than it is at  present.&quot; Subsequently, successive generations  of scientists at Rothamsted have continued to add to the collection to create the  Rothamsted Sample Archive (RSA) we know today providing, in many cases, an  unbroken record of samples pertaining to the Rothamsted Long-Term Experiments (LTEs).  Today, there are over 300,000 samples in the RSA, with around 1,200 crop and  200 soil samples being added each year. </p>

  <p>The  RSA has been housed in various sites around the Rothamsted site in Harpenden as  it has grown. Samples were  originally stored in the Old Barn Laboratory at Hatching Green until 1855. They were then moved to the Testimonial  Laboratory and stored there until 1890 (a building later demolished in 1914) when they were then transferred to the purpose-built Sample House  (now called the &lsquo;Old  Sample House&rsquo;, the oldest surviving building on the research institute part of  the site). This was in use until  1948/49 when samples were moved to the Manor Store. The RSA was moved to its current location, a new bespoke storage facility, in 2009 with room for several future decades of  samples. The field samples are processed in the Sample Processing Facility in  the Jenkinson building, a purpose-built facility with threshing machines, large  ovens, and mills. From there they are transferred to the RSA for storage  according to established protocols for each LTE. The building is not air-conditioned,  or humidity controlled but is dark and cool and receives some heating in the  winter.</p>
  <p>This unique resource is of immense value and has been used  extensively by both Rothamsted staff and scientists throughout the world. The  opportunities provided by modern techniques to analyse these historic archived  materials, provide insights into changes over the last 180 years (2023), and  knowledge for future agronomic and ecological developments. No other global long-term  experiments have such an archive. The RSA is a key component of the Rothamsted  Long-Term Experiments National Biosciences Research Infrastructure (RLTE-NBRI).

  <h4>The samples</h4>
  <p>Plant samples consist of oven-dried (80&degC)  finely-ground  and unground (whole or chopped) grain, straw and herbage as well as material  from other crops. Samples are archived from each of the major LTEs every year  (though whole unground crop samples are only archived from three principal LTEs).</p>
<p>Soil  samples from the topsoil (generally 0-23 cm depth) and some from the subsoils (occasionally  down to 200 cm depth), are air dried. They are taken from the main LTEs every  few years according to experiment-specific protocols. The soil samples are  usually stored as sieved (&lt;6.35 or &lt;2-mm) or finely-ground samples. </p>
  <p>Samples  of the manures and fertilizers that have been applied to the different LTEs are  also archived. These are useful for looking at nutrient inputs and for  contaminants. Most of the fertilizers (excluding N) and manures date from the 1940s.<br />
    <br />
    Early  experiments at Rothamsted included work on animals and diet. There are some  animal part samples, which now are only really curiosities. </p>
<p>The  samples are stored in a variety of containers - sealed glass bottles, jars, and  vials, airtight tins or card boxes, each with a unique bar code label and  identification number. Each shelf has a unique identifier and sample locations  are recorded in a database. The vast majority of the samples are from the  Classicals and other LTEs at the main Rothamsted site in Harpenden, but there  are also samples retained from finished or continuing LTEs at the Woburn Experimental  Farm (Bedfordshire) and finished LTEs at Saxmundham (Suffolk). In addition,  several thousand soil samples collected from around the world in the 1920-1950s,  for a variety of reasons, are also stored.</p>
<p>During  and following World War II there was a shortage of raw materials to make  containers due to rationing that continued through to the 1950s, and so staff  brought in tins from home for sample storage use. These are an interesting  record of those times.

  <h4>Use of the samples</h4>
<p>Initially,  samples were analysed at the time for their nutrient content, including N, C,  P, K, Na, Mg etc. With the development of successive new analytical techniques  the samples can be used for many other studies, both to study environmental  effects and farm management procedures. For instance, detecting changes in  atmospheric inputs, the development of fungicide/herbicide resistance, effects  on plant pathogen populations, carbon modelling and investigating microplastics  in sewage sludge (see Case Studies). In short, the RSA is a globally-unique  record of both environmental change and agricultural management change.</p>
  </p>
  <h4>Access &amp; Collaboration</h4>
  <p>The  use of the RSA in new collaborative research is actively encouraged as part of our  objectives for the RLTE-NBRI. To discuss access to the RSA, please contact one  of the RLTE-NBRI team, such as the project lead, the technician, or the e-RA  data curators (see below). Access to the RSA is ultimately managed through  Rothamsted&rsquo;s Sample and Measurement Request system, itself managed by the Farm  and Field Experiments Committee (FFEC), ideally via a Rothamsted Collaborator. Further  details of this and an online request / expression of interest form are available here:</p>

  <p>Completion  of this form is not a guarantee that the request will be granted, as the  resource is finite, but requests will be carefully considered. </p>
