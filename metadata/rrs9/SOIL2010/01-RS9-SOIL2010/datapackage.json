  "description": "### Abstract\nThe Acid Strip is a narrow strip of land on the the northern edge of Hoosfield, Rothamsted. The strip received large uneven applications of chalk (lime) in the 1850s, and no chalk since. This uneven application of chalk has lead to a dramatic decline in soil pH from East to West. No P or K fertilizer or manure has been applied to the site. Winter wheat is now grown, given 100 kgN/ha. This dataset contains the soil pH and soil phosphorus (P) data measured in August 2010, as reported by Turner and Blackwell (2013).\n### Methods\nSoil samples (0-23cm) were taken from the 200m long Acid Strip at 10m intervals, with additional samples taken at 5 m intervals between 50 and 120m. The soil was air-dried and sieved to <2mm. Soil pH, Olsen P, total P (by ignition) and NaOH-EDTA extractable P were measured.\n### Technical Info\n- **Soil pH**  using a Jenway 3320 pH meter (Bibby Scientific Ltd, Stone, UK). \r\n- **Olsen P** extracted with a solution of 0.5 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, bufferred at pH 8.5, after the method of Olsen et al, 1954.  \r\n- **NaOH_RP** Reactive P concentration in NaOH-EDTA extracts\r\n- **NaOH_TP** Total P concentration in NaOH-EDTA extracts\r\n- **NaOH_UP** Unreactive P concentration in NaOH-EDTA extracts\r\n- **TP** Total P concentration by ignition\n### Provenance\nSoil samples taken by the authors in August 2010 from the Acid Strip.\n### Quality\nAll soil sample analysis performance is strictly monitored using in-house standard materials. Standards and check samples are monitored and recorded.\n",
