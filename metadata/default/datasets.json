The figure above shows the temperature anomaly in annual mean air temperature (black circles), for years 1878 to 2019, relative to the 1878 to 1920 long-term average, which represents the pre-industrial era. Variation in annual temperature is smoothed using an 11-year (132 month) moving average (red line, which removes solar variability and shorter-term variability such as the Southern Oscillation (Hansen et. al., 2010)). The figure shows that air temperatures have risen sharply since 1987 (Scott, 2015) with annual temperatures, over the last decade, estimated to be between 1.3&deg;C and 1.6&deg;C higher than the pre-industrial period (Hansen. et. al., 2016). Much of the rise is due to increases in temperature during the autumn and winter months, and at night-time.",

To control weeds, the experiment was divided into five sections in the 1920s and one section bare fallowed each year. The introduction of herbicides removed the need for fallowing. Yields of continuous wheat given no fertilizer or manure have remained at around 1 t ha-1. In 1968 a rotation was introduced on part of the experiment, so that it is now possible to compare the yields of wheat grown continuously and as the first wheat after a two-year break. Since 1979 summer fungicides have been used, which has allowed us to exploit the greater grain yield potential of modern cultivars. From 1985, two higher N rates have been tested, 240 and 288 kg N ha -1. The highest yields are now from the first wheat crop in rotation, with the greatest yields from fertilizer alone exceeding those from FYM alone, and the combination of FYM + 96 kgN ha-1 (144 kgN ha-1 since 2005) often exceeding both. The largest annual wheat yields on Broadbalk (>13 t ha-1) were recorded in 2014, following the change in variety from Hereward to Crusoe. The greatest yields were not always achieved with the highest N rate. The figure shows the mean greatest first wheat yields achieved from the NPK treatments, receiving up to a maximum of 288 kg N ha-1 (a maximum of 192 kg N ha-1 from 1968-1984). ",

Advances in Agronomy.\r\n\r\nThe field experiment was originally set up as long strips the length of the field and weeded by hand-hoeing. That eventually became impractical and so the experiment was divided into five sections in the 1920s and regular fallowing was introduced to control weeds. The introduction of herbicides on the whole experiment (except on what is now Section 8) in 1964 removed the need for fallowing. In 1968, major changes occurred; the introduction of short-strawed varieties with greater yield potential, and the further division of sections to allow for rotations on some sections of the experiment, so allowing for the comparison of yields of wheat grown continuously or as the first wheat after a two-year break; the form of fertiliser N being tested changed and a higher rate (192 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>) was introduced.

        "description": "This dataset consists of the relative annual frequencies of all non-crop plant species ('weeds') recorded in all eighteen plots of section 8 of the Broadbalk wheat experiment, 1991-2021. Section 8 has not received any herbicides in its history - in contrast to the other sections of Broadbalk which have received herbicides since 1964. Broadbalk section 8 is one of the few arable sites in the country where herbicides have never been applied. Consequently it is populated by a rich diversity of arable species, some very rare elsewhere in England. Broadbalk continues to act as a valuable resource for weed investigations 180 years after it was established, for example Moss _et al._ (2004).\r\n\r\nThere have been various surveys of weeds on Broadbalk wheat experiment since its conception in 1843, but not a consistent methodology in these. The first plot-by-plot surveys of weed species were done in 1869 recording the presence of species. The first phase of annual surveys was between 1933-1979 prior to the current layout of sections. The current weed survey was started on section 8 in 1991 and has continued annually ever since - although not on years when that section is in fallow: 1994, 2001, 2008, 2015, 2016 and 2022. Section 8 (called section VA 1958-1967) was created in 1968 when the experiment was divided into its present layout (Broadbalk plan today).  \r\n\r\nThe current assessment method records the presence of individual weed species in 25 random quadrats (0.1m<sup>2</sup>) per plot. The plots receive differing types and rates of fertilizer treatments and the weed species reflect these. Each year all 18 plots are surveyed meaning 450 quadrats are assessed per year, usually in June. Frequencies refer to the total number of quadrats in which a weed is recorded, the maximum being 25 per plot and 450 across all plots in the section. This method is more appropriate for detecting long-term trends in weed frequencies and population differences between plots than the earlier surveys and provides a comprehensive set of 20 years of data for weed studies.  \r\n\r\nThere have been 60 different species identified over the 30-year duration of this current survey, but many of these only occur sporadically and around 30 of these are currently recorded annually. This site also provides an invaluable reserve for seven nationally rare or uncommon species including corn cleavers (_Galium tricornutum_), corn buttercup (_Ranunculus arvensis_), shepherds needle (_Scandix pecten-veneris_) and prickly poppy (_Papaver argemone_). This is now the only location in the UK where corn cleavers is known to occur naturally. \r\n\r\nThis valuable resource, and associated data, allows the study of long-term interactions between plant species, an opportunity to test current controversies in population and community ecology such as equilibrium theories which require data on resource requirements and loss rates. The long time series enables the detection of cycles in the abundance of individual species; to determine to stability of weed communities; it  enables various weed investigations including weed population ecology; studies on the effects of fallowing on the weed seed bank; seed dormancy and persistence; agroecology and population dynamics of individual weed species. Recently, molecular approaches have been used to study the genetic diversity of weeds found on Section 8, this rare herbicide-free arable plot. On plots where inorganic nitrogen fertiliser has been applied, potential yield losses from weeds have consistently increased since 1969. This was explained by a warming climate, measured as air temperature averaged over the growing season for the weeds, and a shift towards shorter crop cultivars (Storkey et al 2021). Weeds on Broadbalk may genetically more competitive now due to selection for more competitive individuals\r\n\r\n\r\nThis dataset also provides the yields of the plots both with and without the weight of the weed seeds. The percentage of weed seeds in the total grain varies between greatly, between 1-71.8% of the total grain yield. The year 2012 was a particularly high weed year followed by 2007 and 2013.  \r\n\r\n**Herbicide Resistance Studies:** This section 8 of Broadbalk is an important source of susceptible seed of the weed _Alopecurus myosuroides_, blackgrass. It provides an excellent standard susceptible strain for use in herbicide-resistance assays, as having never received herbicides the grass-weed has never evolved herbicide resistance. See \"Herbicide resistance in _Alopecurus myosuroides_: The value of routine testing of seed samples submitted by farmers since 1985\", Cook et al. Weed Research (2023). ",

Infection was greatest in 3rd wheats and continuous wheat, and least in 1st wheats. Fertilizer application rates influenced infection, with the lowest rates in plots where one or more nutrients was missing (plots 10 and 11). The plots treated with the most nitrogen (plots 15 and 21) had the highest BFR scores, as also reported for Broadbalk by Glynne (1969) and in dilution plating studies by Bateman and Coskun (1995) and Snyder and Nash (1968).  \r\n\r\nThis dataset was assembled by Amisha Pradhan in summer 2021 as part of the Nuffield Research Placements Summer Studentship scheme.",

        "description": "This dataset provides mean long-term yields of winter wheat (grain at 85% dry matter) from 1852-2022 in response to selected treatments on the Broadbalk \"Classical\" long-term experiment. The Figure shows the long-term trends and yields achieved under various scenarios in comparison with the original practices. The data are mean values over various numbers of years and/or cultivars; there is considerable year-to-year variability (data for individual years are available from the Broadbalk Complete Open Access dataset or e-eRAdata). Trends reflect the treatments and agronomic practices introduced on Broadbalk such as continuous wheat (solid lines) and rotations (dashed lines), old varieties until 1967 versus modern short-strawed cultivars since 1968, and the management of pests, weeds and diseases, introduced at various times since the 1920s. This new updated version of the figure includes data from 2017-2022 and a treatment of \"best continuous wheat\" as a comparison to the \"best rotational wheat\" treatment. A new rotation with two 1st wheats, using the yields after a one-year break of beans since 2018, is indicated by a break in the dashed lines, top right.\r\n\r\nThe experiment was originally set up as long strips the length of the field and weeded by hand-hoeing. That eventually became impractical and so the experiment was divided into five sections in the 1920s and regular fallowing was introduced to control weeds. The introduction of herbicides on the whole experiment (except on what is now Section 8) in 1964 removed the need for fallowing. In 1968, major changes occurred; the introduction of short-strawed varieties with greater yield potential, and the further division of sections to allow for rotations on some sections of the experiment, so allowing for the comparison of yields of wheat grown continuously or as the first wheat after a two-year break. The form of fertiliser N being tested changed and a higher rate (192 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>) was introduced. Since 1979, summer fungicides have been used, exploiting the greater grain yield potential of modern cultivars. From 1985, two further higher N rates have been tested (240 and 288 kg N ha <sup>-1</sup>). Since 2000, P has been withheld from selected plots (as plant-available P is not limiting) and split-N applications was introduced on some plots. New varieties of wheat are introduced to maintain relevance with current agricultural practice. Since 1968 there have been various crop rotations, indicated top right of figure. A new five-year rotation was introduced from 2018 with two 1st-wheats, one after a legume, the other after a non-legume (wheat>wheat>oats>wheat> beans, Sections 2, 3, 4,5 and 7).\r\n\r\nThe largest yields are from wheat in rotation rather than continuous wheat. They are usually from the first wheat crop in rotation and often from the combination of FYM + 96 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> (144 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> since 2005, plot 2.1) rather than from inorganic fertilizer alone. For continuous wheat, the best NPK treated plots yield more than either FYM alone (plot 2.2) or PKMg + 144 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> (plot 8). The largest annual wheat yields ever recorded on Broadbalk was 13.8 t ha<sup>-1</sup> in 2014 (variety Crusoe; plot 17 N1+4+1PKMg). The largest yield in the drought year of 2022 was 12.22 t ha-1 (variety Zyatt; a 2nd wheat on plot 2.1 FYM+N3), the tenth-highest yield ever recorded. Note that the best yields are not always achieved with the highest N rate (see Complete Open Access dataset). The figure shows the mean best 1st  wheat yields achieved from the NPK treatments, receiving up to a maximum of 288 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> (up to 192 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> from 1968-1984). This is always much more than the equivalent best continuous wheat NPK yield. Yields of continuous wheat given no fertilizer or manure (Nil plots 3) have remained at around 1 t ha<sup>-1</sup> in general. However, these yields dipped in the late 1910s and early 1920s due to weed infestation arising (at least in part) from a reduced labour force during and after the First World War, and have again fallen since the 1980s, possibly due to lower inputs of atmospheric N. The yields from the continuous wheat plots with (P)KMg + 144 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> have fallen also over the last few years, whereas the yields from the continuous wheat with FYM have increased, although note that this last point is the mean of only 3 years.

        "description": "The accumulation of organic carbon in soil and tree biomass has been measured on two contrasting sites at Rothamsted that were fenced off in the 1880s and left to revert naturally to woodland. Broadbalk, on calcareous soil, and Geescroft Wilderness, on acidic soil. Previously, both sites had been in arable cultivation for centuries.\r\n\r\nThe Broadbalk site was part of the Broadbalk wheat experiment, and had grown unmanured winter wheat since autumn 1843. Large amounts of chalk had been applied to the soil in the late 18th - early 19th centuries, and the surface soil pH is still neutral (pH 7.7 in 1999). The site is small (0.2ha). It was previously a long-term arable site, and was allowed to naturally regenerate to deciduous woodland following abandonment of arable cropping. The last wheat crop was sown in autumn 1881, but not harvested. In 1882, the site was then fenced off, left uncultivated and unharvested. No fertilizer or manure were applied. In 1900 it was divided into two halves: one half remained untouched (regenerating woodland). The other half had all woody species removed annually (stubbed), to allow open ground vegetation to develop. In 1957 the stubbed section was divided into two, one half remains as 'stubbed', the other half was mown for three years, grazed by sheep each year from 1960-2000, mown since 2001 (herbage not removed). Data for 'stubbed' and grassland areas is not shown, but is available on request from the e-RA curators.\r\n\r\nBroadbalk Wilderness is now dominated by ash (Fraxinus excelsior), with sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) and hawthorn (Craetagus monogyna); in contrast, the acidic Geescroft Wilderness is now a deciduous wood dominated by oak (Quercus robur).\r\n\r\nThe figure shows the accumulation of organic carbon in the soil and in tree root and above-ground biomass in the Broadbalk Wilderness, 1881-1999. The soil has been sampled to an equivalent depth of 69cm (see Poulton et al, 2003 for further details). The site has gained 3.39 t C/ha/year over the 120 year period (0.54 t in the soil plus an estimated 2.85 t in trees and roots). Unlike the Geescroft wilderness site, the amount of C in the litter layer is negligible, as the litter decomposes each year. This selected data is from work published in Poulton et al. (2003). Data on the accumulation of nitrogen is also available from the e-RA curators.\r\n\r\nThe figure shows the accumulation of organic carbon in the soil and in tree root and above-ground biomass in the Broadbalk Wilderness, 1881-1999.",

Soil N was measured from 1987 onwards. Total C, Inorganic C, Soil pH, Olsen P and exchangeable cations are measured from 2000 onwards. The site was in long-term arable cropping since at least 1881 before the experiment started (Lawes and Gilbert, 1885). Originally there were 12 blocks, but blocks 5-12 were discontinued from 1968 and only blocks 1-4 were continued. See Johnston (1973) for a discussion of the effects of ley and arable cropping on SOC in blocks 5-12, 1949-1972.  \r\n\r\nFosters Ley-arable experiment is a comparison to the Highfield Ley-arable experiment. The two sites have the same soil type but very different histories. Fosters was in long-term arable, with little SOC at the start, in contrast to Highfield which was old permanent grass and consequently had more SOC at the start.\r\n\r\nThis dataset was assembled by Fergus Blyth in 2022 and 2023 as part of a year spent on placement for an MSci degree from the University of Glasgow.\r\n\r\nThis work was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council [NE/S007423/1], through the ENVISION Doctoral Training Partnership, Research Experience Placement scheme.

The experiment as a whole underwent five different phases of treatment (see below). This data is from that half of the experiment, established in 1986, called the 'P Test' which tested the effects of different levels of plant available P on crop yields and P uptake. It also contains data from the preceding 10/12 years.\r\n\r\nPrior to the 'P test', fertilizer N was applied. This had increased yields and allowed the crop to take greater advantage of the P and K residues remaining in the soil from an earlier phase (Phase I) of the experiment. These were initially large but declined as amounts of phosphate in the soil declined. In Phase IV, from 1986, because the P residues had been exhausted it was decided to see how quickly this decline in soil fertility could be reversed - annual cumulative dressings of P as triple phosphate were tested (four different rates on four sub-plots) and spring barley grown - this is known as the 'P test'. Basal N & K were applied so that was not limited. Yield responses to available-P were rapid and showed that above a critical level on this soil, of about 10-12 mg kg P there is no further increase in yield. No P was applied between 1993-1999. Maintenance dressings of P have been applied since 2000 (but not to the P0 sub-plots). ",

To control weeds, the whole experiment was bare fallowed four times, in 1912, 1933, 1943 and 1967. Herbicides were introduced in 1945 and regular liming began in 1955. From 1852-1966 the Unfertilized and FYM plots did not receive any fertilizer N, whereas N1PKMg received 48 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>. In 1968, the main plots were divided to test four rates of N (0, 48, 96 and 144 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>); these have rotated each year since 1974. In 1970 modern short-strawed cultivars with greater yield potential were introduced, and, since 1978, summer fungicides have been used, which has allowed us to exploit that potential.\r\n\r\nYields of spring barley given no fertilizer or manure have remained at around 1 t ha<sup>-1</sup> throughout the experiment. Between 1852 and 1970, the highest yields were from the plot given 35 t ha<sup>-1</sup> of FYM each year. The highest yields are now from the plot given FYM with fertilizer N (a maximum of 144 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>), exceeding those given just inorganic fertilizers. This shows the importance of soil organic matter and good soil structure for spring-sown crops, which facilitates rooting and access to water and nutrients. The comparable Broadbalk Yields graph suggests that this is not necessarily true for winter-sown crops. There is no longer a yield benefit to the spring barley on the plot given FYM for just 20 years, 1852-71.\r\nThe greatest yields were not always achieved with the highest N rate. The figure shows the greatest yields achieved each year for the NPKMg and FYM+N treatments. These are the means of the highest yields achieved each year with fertilizer N, up to a maximum of 144 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>.\r\nFrom 1968 to 1978 three course rotations of potatoes, beans and barley were introduced on parts of the experiment, to compare the yields of spring barley grown continuously and after a two year break. The best yields in rotation were only 0.3 t ha<sup>-1</sup> more than for continuous barley, and the rotations were discontinued in 1979 (data not shown). This is in contrast to the Broadbalk Experiment, where winter wheat yields after a two-year break can be more than 2 t ha<sup>-1</sup> larger than yields of continuous wheat. Part of the reason may be that spring cropping allows more effective weed control than winter cropping, especially when herbicides are used.",

Applying N as sodium nitrate (orange line N*) or ammonium sulphate (blue line N) quickly decreased species numbers relative to the unfertilised control.  The continued application of ammonium decreases species numbers further because of its acidifying effect on the soil (pH 3.6 in 2011, solid blue line), reducing the number of species to one or two, Holcus lanatus (Yorkshire Fog) and Anthoxanthum odoratum (Sweet Vernal Grass). However, even on the nil plot (solid green line) the number of species has decreased. This may be due to changes in atmospheric inputs and/or changes in sward management.\r\n\r\nApplying chalk (dotted lines) increased soil pH (pH 6.2 in 2011, dotted blue line) and helped some of the species return to the original numbers. Recent work (Storkey et al 2015) showed that on some plots withholding N helped increase species diversity as did decreased atmospheric N deposition, as evident in the species numbers of the nil plot (solid green line).",

Since 1856 its various plots have received differing fertilizer and manure treatments and from 1903 sub-plots have received lime to adjust the pH of the soils. These differing treatment applications have resulted in dramatic differences in species composition, in what had previously been a uniform sward.\r\n\r\nThis dataset contains photographic images of all sub-plots of Park Grass as well as species numbers per sub-plot and sward heights. The photos are set out in a group order relating to the fertilizer treatments they receive with nil plots at the top of the table followed by no-ntirogen plots and then the two differing N treatments (ammonium and nitrate) with increasing fertilizer amounts as you go down the table. The farmyard manure (FYM) plots are at the bottom of the table. The nil to no N treatments at the top are associated with a high number of species and low sward height and as fertilizer treatments increase the number of species generally goes down. Likewise, across the table left to right species numbers change as pH decreases, a lower number of species being associated with the more acidic d plots that receive no lime, to the right of the table.\r\n\r\nThe plots with no nutrients added or no nitrogen,  have certain species associated with them such as Pignut, Birds-foot Trefoil, Bugle, Rough Hawkbit, Meadow Buttercup, Red Clover, Ribwort Plantain. Plots further down the table with increasing nitrogen inputs tend to be dominated by Cow Parsley, Meadow Foxtail. Sweet Vernal Grass and Yorkshire Fog dominate on plots that have become very acidic. The FYM plots at the bottom of the table have more species and lower height of sward than those receiving inorganic fertilizers. \r\n\r\nThe plots with no fertilizer or manure added have the highest species diversity support shorter broadleaf species that are outcompeted by the tall grasses on other plots where high rates of fertilizers are added. The red clover and meadow vetchlings, mainly found on plots with no nitrogen or phosphorous added, are legumes and can obtain their nitrogen from the air and have an advantage on these plots. The plots with high rates of nitrogen fertilizer added in combination with phosphorous and potassium are dominated by tall grasses and forbs which are competitive and shade out shorter species that then cannot persist, these plots produce the highest overall hay yield biomass.",

From 1965, the plots were further divided: two quarters of the previously limed half receive amounts of chalk calculated to maintain pH at 7 (sub plot a) and 6 (sub plot b); one part of the formerly un-limed half receives chalk, where necessary, to maintain pH 5 (sub plot c), and the other quarter (sub plot d) remains un-limed.\r\n\r\nExcept where sodium nitrate (orange line N*) has been applied or where liming with chalk has maintained the pH (dashed lines), soil has acidified slowly through the impact of acid deposition from the atmosphere and rapidly where ammonium fertiliser (blue line N) has been applied. Soil pH (0-23cm) is c 3.5 on the plots given most ammonium sulphate and 5.0-5.3 on the un-limed, unfertilized plots. Sub plot c of most plots is nearest to the original soil pH.

Results are given as tonnes per hectare of organic C for 0-22.5 cm depth of soil, based on measured soil weights, and adjusted for changes in bulk density.\r\n\r\nThe figure shows the grassland contains two-thirds as much SOC as the arable at Highfield  (and twice as much at Fosters ). SOC increased with improved grassland management on Highfield while on Fosters it increased under newly sown grass but, after 60 years there was still less than in the permanent grassland soil on Highfield, possibly because, after 1991 and the change to grass/clover on the whole plot it is likely that yields would have been less and thus a smaller input from root exudates and dead roots. With arable cropping, large amounts of SOC were lost on Highfield but it took 50 years to decline to that on Fosters. The figure shows that after 60 years the soils appear to be reaching equilibrium following changes in the cropping system level for this farming system on this soil type. Thus, in soils ploughed out of permanent grass or put into permanent grass after arable cropping the SOC now appears relatively constant. On any one soil type, the equilibrium level will be larger with permanent grass than with continuous arable cropping. ",

        "description": "Summary data showing the effect of two contrasting farming systems, Fosters Ley Arable, which was originally long-term arable for several centuries, and Highfield Ley Arable, which was originally permanent grassland, on their soil organic carbon (SOC) at Rothamsted over a 60-year time-period 1948-2008. Results are given as tonnes per hectare of organic C for 0-22.5 cm depth of soil, based on measured soil weights, and adjusted for changes in bulk density.\r\n\r\nThe figure shows the grassland contains two-thirds as much SOC  as the arable at Fosters (and twice as much SOC at Highfield). SOC increased on Fosters under newly sown grass and it also increased with improved grassland management on Highfield. However, after 60 years there was still less SOC in Fosters sown grass than in the permanent grassland soil on Highfield. This possibly is because, after 1991 and the change to grass/clover on the whole plot, it is likely that yields would have been less and thus a smaller input from root exudates and dead roots. With arable cropping, large amounts of SOC were lost on Highfield but it took 50 years to decline to that on Fosters. The figure shows that after 60 years the soils appear to be reaching equilibrium following changes in the cropping system level for this farming system on this soil type. Thus, in soils ploughed out of permanent grass or put into permanent grass after arable cropping the SOC now appears relatively constant. On any one soil type, the equilibrium level will be larger with permanent grass than with continuous arable cropping. ",

        "description": "The experiment tests the effects of different amounts of lime (and thus soil pH), P and K on a sequence of arable crops, on a sandy soil at Woburn Experimental Farm, from 1962-1996. Mg, Mn and S were tested on split plots at different times. Target soil pH was 4.5, 5.5, 6.5 and 7.5. This dataset contains soil pH, Olsen P and exchangeable cations (Ca, K, Mg and Na, ammonium acetate method) on soil sampled several times between 1962 and 1996.  There was also a baseline sampling before the experiment was established. There is a parallel experiment at Rothamsted Experimental Farm. This experiment was discontinued in 1997.  \r\n\r\nThis dataset was partially funded by the BBSRC Institute Strategic Programme Soil to Nutrition (BBS/E/C/000I0310). ",
