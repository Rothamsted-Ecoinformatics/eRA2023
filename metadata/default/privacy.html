    <h2>PRIVACY NOTICES</h2>
    <p class="mx-3 px-3">
        e-RA collects specific, relevant, and minimal personal information to provide you with the services you
        requested, manage our communication with you, and report our work to our funding agencies.
    </p>
    <p class="mx-3 px-3">When we receive, hold or use your personal information, we will provide you with a Privacy Notice (PN) which
        sets out in detail what information we hold about you, how your personal information may be used, how long for,
        and
        the reasons for these uses, together with details of your rights.
    </p>
    <p class="mx-3 px-3">We will provide this PN at the time we collect the personal information from you directly or when we first
        contact you, first pass the data to someone else or within a month, whichever is the earlier.
    </p>
    <p class="mx-3 px-3">We will do that at least once, generally at the start of our relationship with you.
    </p>
    <p class="mx-3 px-3">If the applicable PN is updated substantially, we will provide you with details of the updated version. You
        are encouraged to check regularly for updates.
    </p>
    <h2>HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
    <p class="mx-3 px-3">e-RA collects information to understand how the data is used, to manage your requests and for justification
    of our continued funding.</p>
    <h3>When requesting access to e-RAdata</h3> 
   
    <p class="mx-3 px-3">The information collected via the <a href="https://www.era.rothamsted.ac.uk/newGold.php">request form</a> is summarized at submission and in the confirmation email.
    </p>
    <p class="mx-3 px-3">The information collected via the request form is used to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Assist you specifically - answering your question to the professional level you expect.
        </li>
        <li> Set up username and password when appropriate.
        </li>
        <li> Ensure proper usage and citation of the material.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>When a dataset is downloaded</h3>
    <p class="mx-3 px-3">There is a short form that collects personal information from you - name, country, institute, and reason to
        download is requested. These is not compulsory, and the download will still happen if you do not provide
        information. These are recorded in our database and really help our understanding of how our data is used, so we
        appreciate your help in that matter.
    </p>
    <p class="mx-3 px-3">The IP address from which the data was downloaded is also recorded. This can be considered personal data in some
        cases but not in some others.
    </p>
    <h2>WHO DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH?</h2>
    <p class="mx-3 px-3">Generally, we share information with a relevant party to provide services to you or to comply with agreements
        that we have entered with you to the extent that this is strictly necessary, and we will put in place
        arrangements to protect your personal information. We do not disclose your personal information unless we are
        required to do so by law.
    </p>
    <p class="mx-3 px-3">If we need to transfer personal information about you outside the European Economic Area (EEA), we will let you
        know and ensure that all reasonable security measures are taken.
    </p>
    <p class="mx-3 px-3">We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others.
    </p>
    <h2>HOW LONG DO WE HOLD ON TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
