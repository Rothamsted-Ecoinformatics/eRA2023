        "Comment": "A gradient of soils with increasing metal contamination was constructed by mixing uncontaminated farmyard manure-treated (FYM) and contaminated, sewage sludge-treated (S) soils from the Woburn Experimental Farm, and separate samples of these soils were inoculated with strains of <i>Rhizobium leguminosarum</i> bv. <i> trifolii, R. meliloti</i> and <i>R. loti</i>. The survival of rhizobia in these soils was monitored using most-probable number (MPN) plant infection tests. After 51 days incubation numbers of <i>R. meliloti</i> were similar in all of the soils irrespective of the heavy metal content, whilst the numbers of <i>R. leguminosarum</i> bv. <i>trifolii</i> and <i>R. loti</i> were reduced in soils containing more than 2/3 sludge-treated soil. The numbers of<i> R. leguminosarum</i> bv.<i> trifolii</i> were monitored in the same gradient of soils over a 171 day period and differences in survival between the soils were only apparent from 27 days in soil mixtures containing more than 5/6 sludge-treated soil. After 171 days the number of cells surviving had decreased even in the soil mixture containing 1/6 sludge-treated soil when compared with the uncontaminated FYM-treated soil. The populations of indigenous <i>R. leguminosarum</i> bv. <i>trifolii</i> were also monitored in the soil of the FYM-treated and S-treated plots in the field. Numbers of rhizobia remained at around 4 x 10(4) cells g soil-1 in the FYM-treated soil over 3 yr after clover was removed, but gradually declined in the S-treated soil to 1 x 10(3) cells g soil-1.",

        "Comment": "The larger crops grown when inorganic N fertilizer is applied return more organic N to the soil as crop residues (roots, root exudates, stubble, etc.). These additional inputs are small but cumulative, and in the long term the continuous use of fertilizer N may indirectly increase the total organic N content of the soil, and thus N mineralization. The Broadbalk Continuous Wheat Experiment at Rothamsted provides an opportunity to investigate these effects, as it includes plots given the same rates of inorganic N fertilizer each year since 1852 (0, 48, 96 or 144 kg N ha-<sup>1 yr-<sup>1, referred to as the N0, N1, N2 and N3 treatments). Winter wheat is grown each year and the straw removed. The N4 treatment has received 192 kg N ha-<sup>1 yr-<sup>1 since 1968; previously it received the N1 treatment. The application of 35 t ha-<sup>1 of farmyard manure each year since 1843 has more than doubled soil organic N content, and lead to an even greater increase in mineralizable N. In contrast, long term applications of inorganic N have had a much smaller effect on total soil N - at most an increase of 20%, or 0.5 t N ha-<sup>1 (0-23 cm) after 130 years of applying 144 kg N ha-<sup>1. However, the effect on N mineralization appears to be much greater. Depending on the method of estimation, soil from the N3 treatment appears to mineralize at least 60% more N than soil never given fertilizer N, with an increase in crop uptake of mineralized N of as much as 30 kg N ha-<sup>1. This suggests that the small amount of additional organic N returned to the soil as a result of using inorganic N is in a fraction that turns over more rapidly than the N in the older organic matter. Soil under the N4 treatment, started only 20 years ago, contains less total N than the N3 treatment, but an equal or greater amount of mineralizable N, suggesting that changes in mineralizable N occur more quickly than changes in total N. An increase in N mineralization that benefits subsequent crops may also increase the risk of nitrate leaching, with the consequent pollution of aquifers.",

        "Comment": "Understanding changes in plant-soil C, N and P using data alone is difficult due to the linkages between carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycles (C, Nand P), andmultiple changing long-termdrivers (e.g. climate, land-use, and atmospheric N deposition). Hence, dynamic models are a vital tool for disentangling these drivers, helping us understand the dominant processes and drivers and predict future change. However, it is essential that models are tested against data if their outputs are to be concluded uponwith confidence. Here, a simulation of C, N and P cycles using the N14CP modelwas compared with time-series observations of C, N and P in soils and biomass from the Rothamsted Research long-termexperiments spanning 150 years, providing an unprecedented temporal integrated test of such a model. N14CP reproduced broad trends in soil organicmatter (SOM) C, N and P, vegetation biomass and N and P leaching. Subsequently, the model was used to decouple the effects of land management and elevated nitrogen deposition in these experiments. Elevated N deposition over the last 150 years is shown to have increased net primary productivity (NPP) 4.5-fold and total carbon sequestration 5-fold at the Geescroft Wilderness experiment, which was re-wilded to woodland in 1886. In contrast, the model predicts that for cropped grassland conditions at the Park Grass site, elevated N deposition has very little effect on SOM, as increases in NPP are diverted from the soil. More broadly, these results suggest that N deposition is likely to have had a large effect on SOM and NPP in northern temperate and boreal semi-natural grasslands and forests. However, in cropped and grazed systems in the same region, whilst NPP may have been supported in part by elevated N deposition, declines in SOM may not have been appreciably counteracted by increased N availability.

        "Comment": "The quantity of carbon (C) held in organic matter in the world\u2019s soils to a depth of 1m is estimated at about 1,500 Gt, about twice that currently in atmospheric CO2, and thus significant in the global C cycle and in influencing climate change. The \u20184 per mille\u2019 initiative, launched at the Paris Climate Conference in 2015, proposed that current annual CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burning could be completely offset if the global stock of soil organic carbon (SOC) was increased annually at the rate of 4 parts per 1000 (4\u2030 or 0.4%) of the current value. At Rothamsted Research we used SOC data from our long-term 7 to 157 years, to assess the rate at which SOC could be increased. Treatments included organic additions (manure, straw, cover crops), nitrogen (N) fertilisers, introducing pasture leys into continuous arable systems, and converting arable land to woodland. With drastic changes to soil management or land use, the annual 4\u2030 rate of SOC increase was met or exceeded, in some cases over many years. But within management practices more easily adopted in practice it is very difficult to reach this rate of increase. Practices that were very effective at sequestering C included (a) removing land from arable cropping and converting to woodland and (b) changing from continuous arable cropping to a leyarable rotation comprising eight years pasture followed by two years of arable crops. However, both changes would have major impacts on food security and farmers\u2019 incomes. Manure applications caused large SOC increases but there are major practical and environmental constraints to applying the large rates (35 t fresh material ha-1 annually) used in the longest running experiments. It is also questionable whether manure applications represent genuine climate mitigation as opposed to relocation of organic C; though manure delivers numerous soil quality benefits. Changing to zero tillage and the wider use of cover crops are practical measures that offer potential to increase SOC. However, we consider that the 4\u2030 annual rate of SOC increase is unachievable in most agricultural situations and cannot be regarded as a major contributor to climate change mitigation. It is more realistic to promote practices for increasing SOC because they improve soil quality and functioning, especially as small increases can have disproportionately large beneficial impacts, though not necessarily translating into increased crop yield. Improved management of nitrogen in agriculture, decreasing direct and indirect nitrous oxide emissions, is probably a more effective means of mitigating climate change in agriculture. ",

        "Comment": "1 The Bibury long-term data set contains information on annual fluctuations in the abundance of over 100 grasses and forbs in roadside verge vegetation over the period from 1958 to the present. Monitoring has been carried out every July by the same individual. The data set represents a unique long-term record of the dynamics of a complete plant community. 2 Records for the most abundant taxa (including bare ground and litter) were used to determine the effect of climate variability on the year-to-year performance of the selected species. Residuals about the long-term mean log biomass of each species (detrended where the species showed a significant increase or decrease in abundance over time) were correlated against indices of interannual climate variability. Plant and weather records were compared over 3-month seasonal periods (March-May, June-August, September-November, December-February) or 6-month seasonal periods (March-August, September-February), with time lags of 0, 1 and 2 years. 3 Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to formulate annual weather indices, using either conventional weather variables (temperature, rainfall and sunshine) or the Lamb catalogue of daily weather types. 4 Between 5% and 70% more correlations were observed than might be expected to occur by chance, depending on the season and the PCB index, indicating markedly non-random plant-weather relationships. Total vegetation production was positively correlated with minimum spring temperature. The distribution of correlations was generally evenly distributed across the three lag periods. 5 In general, those species favoured by environmental stress or disturbance were promoted following warm dry springs and summers, whereas those favoured by more productive conditions were promoted following a wet growing season.",

        "Comment": "The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA 2003) framework was applied to provide a holistic assessment and comparison of ecosystem services delivery from 11 environmental change network (ECN) sites, following a workshop of ECN site managers. A list of common variables was agreed to represent the high level categories defined by the MA. The resultant 73 variables, either direct ecosystem services or proxies, were divided into two subsets (readily accessible biogeographical data from all sites and additional site specific data). Similarity analysis of the biogeographical data indicated four site clusters: land with at least 50% forest cover, productive livestock farmland, uplands and a lowland grass/arable group. The first three clusters were also evident for both the additional data and for the larger combined dataset. The lowland grass/arable sites were a -mixed use- cluster that was not apparent in the analysis of the additional or combined datasets indicating a mismatch between particular ecosystem services and specific landscapes/habitats. Procrustes analysis of the biogeographical data and the combined dataset suggested that the primary differences between datasets were due to variables associated with local management decisions which prevented harvesting of provisioning services or denied public access to the site. Drawing on comparable data from some of the most intensively researched and monitored ecosystems in the UK, this study demonstrates the challenges and limitations involved in attempting holistic assessments of ecosystem services at the site and inter-site level and highlights the importance of both local expert knowledge and consistent scientific measurement in contributing to the process.

        "Comment": "Improving irrigation efficiency requires accurate assessment of the soil moisture distribution in time and space, but obtaining accurate observational data is challenging. Early-time signal (ETS) amplitude analysis of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data may permit such rapid noninvasive characterization. In this study we performed controlled irrigation experiments using a multifrequency GPR system to compare two statistics used to quantify the ETS: average envelope amplitude (AEA) and carrier frequency amplitude (CFA). Supporting data were provided by direct measurements, electrical resistivity imaging (ERI), and synthetic modeling. In our first experiment, both statistics successfully related the ETS for 250 and 400 MHz GPR data to increasing water content. However, the 400 MHz AEA lost sensitivity at later stages of the irrigation process, whereas the 400 MHz CFA remained sensitive to changes in water content. The 1000 MHz data did not show the expected relationships, possibly due to shallow reflectors, such as the wetting front, which the higher frequency antennae would have a greater chance of detecting, as supported by synthetic modeling. In our second experiment, we focused on the effect of the time window on calculating ETS statistics. We demonstrate that, when there is interference in the ETS, using a shorter time window instead of the more common first positive half cycle improves correlation with soil moisture content. Our work shows that the GPR ETS data respond to changes in soil water content in similar fashion to ERI data.",

        "Comment": "Most soil tests for available phosphorus (P) perform rather poorly in predicting crop response. This study was set up to compare different established soil tests in their capacity to predict crop response across contrasting types of soil. Soil samples from long-term field experiments, the oldest >100 years old, were collected in five European countries. The total number of soil samples (n = 218), which differed in cropping and P treatment, and originated from 11 different soil types, were analysed with five tests: ammonium oxalate (Ox), ammonium lactate (AL), Olsen P, 0.01 m CaCl2 and the diffusive gradient in thin film (DGT). The first three tests denote available P quantity (Q), whereas the last two indicate P intensity (I) of the soil solution. All five tests were positively related to the crop yield data (n = 317). The Q-tests generally outperformed I-tests when evaluated with goodness of fit in Mitscherlich models, but critical P values of the I-tests varied the least among different types of soil. No test was clearly superior to the others, except for the oxalate extraction, which was generally poor. The combination of Q- and I-tests performed slightly better for predicting crop yield than any single soil P test. This Q + I analysis explains why recent successes with I-tests (e.g. DGT) were found for soils with larger P sorption than for those in the present study. This systematic evaluation of soil tests using a unique compilation of established field trials provides critical soil P values that are valid across Europe. Highlights We compared soil P tests for predicting crop response across contrasting soil types. No test was clearly superior to the others except for the oxalate extraction, which was generally poor. This study suggests that intensity tests do not perform markedly better than quantity tests. The evaluation of soil P tests on this unique dataset provided critical soil P values across Europe.",

        "Comment": "Spectroscopic methods for the determination of soil texture are faster and cheaper than the standard methods, but how do the results compare? To address this question, laser diffraction analysis (LDA) and mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIRS) analysis have been compared to conventional sieve-pipette measurements of texture in diverse European and Kenyan soils. To our knowledge this comparison between LDA and MIRS has not been made previously. It has used soils with a broad range of organic carbon (OC) contents to investigate whether, as in other techniques, clay-OC aggregation affects the estimation of clay with MIRS. The MIRS predictions of clay content were much better than the LDA measurements, but both techniques gave good measurements of sand content. The MIRS over-estimated clay at low clay content and under-estimated at high clay content (calibration set R2?=?0.83). The LDA over-estimated clay by?~?60% (calibration set R2?=?0.36), indicating that the widely used clay threshold of?<?8\u00a0\u00b5m was too high, and?<?4\u00a0\u00b5m was found to be more accurate. In samples with?<?5% OC content, both the LDA and MIRS gave very good clay predictions (R2?=?0.88 and 0.81, respectively). But in predictions of clay content in samples with?>?5% OC the LDA under-estimated (R2?=??<?0.1) and MIRS over-estimated (R2?=?0.34) clay content. In soils with OC removed, the MIRS prediction of clay content improved, indicating interference between over-lapping spectral regions for organic and mineral constituents. Unlike granulometric measurements of texture such as the LDA, MIRS analysis is not subject to the limitations imposed by the shape and density of particles. It was concluded that in typical agricultural soils with?<?5% OC and?<?60% clay content, both techniques could be used for cheap, fast and reliable estimates of soil texture.",

        "Comment": "Nine soil organic models were evaluated using twelve datasets from seven long-term experiments. Datasets represented three different land-uses (grassland, arable cropping and woodland) and a range of climatic conditions within the temperate region. Different treatments (inorganic fertilizer, organic manures and different rotations) at the same site allowed the effects of differing land management to be explored. Model simulations were evaluated against the measured data and the performance of the models was compared both qualitatively and quantitatively. Not all models were able to simulate all datasets; only four attempted all. No one model performed better than all others across all datasets. The performance of each model in simulating each dataset is discussed. A comparison of the overall performance of models across all datasets reveals that the model errors of one group of models (RothC, CANDY, DNDC, CENTURY, DAISY and NCSOIL) did not differ significantly from each other. Another group (SOMM, ITE and Verberne) did not differ significantly from each other but showed significantly larger model errors than did models in the first group. Possible reasons for differences in model performance are discussed in detail. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Comment": "The deterministic modelling of bio-hydrological processes in soil requires a void structure model that is explicitly dual-porous containing fully and separately characterized macroporosity and microporosity. It should also contain information that relates the positioning of microporosity relative to macroporosity. An example of such a process is the production of nitrous oxide, in which bacteria in microporous hot-spots' are supplied with nutrients and gases through a macroporous pathway. We present a precision void-structure model that satisfies these two criteria, namely explicit macroporosity and microporosity, and their positional relationship. To demonstrate the construction of the model, we describe the modelling of a single soil, namely Warren soil from Rothamsted Research's Woburn Experimental Farm in Bedfordshire, UK, although the modelling approach is applicable to a wide range of soils and other dual porous solids. The model is capable of fitting several fundamental properties of soil, namely water retention, aggregate size distribution, and porosity of the microporous and macroporous zones. It comprises a dendritic critical percolation path, around which are clustered the microporous regions. The saturated hydraulic conductivity of the dual-porous network is of the correct order of magnitude for a soil of the same density and texture as the Warren sample. Finally, we demonstrate how the preferential flow pathway in the resulting structure differs from the critical percolation pathway, and that only 4.6% by volume of the unclogged macroporosity contributes to the fluid flow through the structure.",

        "Comment": "In this paper we describe the GCTE global Soil Organic Matter Network (SOMNET) before focusing on the European network of long-term sites. We then select two examples from the European site network and demonstrate how such data can be used to (a) track long-term changes in soil organic matter, (b) evaluate and compare soil organic matter models, and (c) make rough estimates of the potential for carbon (C) sequestration in soils at the regional (European) level. Our simple calculations based on only two long-term experiments suggest that amendment of arable soils with 10 Mg ha(-1) of organic manure could lead to an increase in current total European soil C stock to 30 cm of about 4.8% over 90 yr, a scenario with limited potential for sequestering C, Similarly, afforestation through natural woodland regeneration of 30% of current arable land (surplus to requirements by 2010) could lead to an increase in current total European soil C stock of 12.4% over 100 yr. This is equivalent to 43 Tg C yr(-1) or 3.8% of anthropogenic CO2-C emissions from Europe. If temporary C storage in standing woody biomass is included in the estimate, the amount of C sequestered is quadrupled and could account for 15.28% of Europe's annual CO2-C emissions. This is equivalent to 2.8% of annual global anthropogenic CO2-C emissions. These calculations are presented to demonstrate a simple technique for estimating rough C sequestration potentials but they do suggest some potential to sequester C in European agricultural soils. As a result, a more sophisticated approach using statistical relationships derived from a large number of long-term experiments was developed. The need for balancing the effects of these scenarios on soil C against other environmental considerations is discussed. Methods for improving estimates of the potential for soil C sequestration using the European site network are also discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Comment": "UK grasslands perform important environmental and economic functions, but their future productivity under climate change is uncertain. Spring hay yields from 1902 to 2016 at one site (the Park Grass Long Term Exper\u0002iment) in southern England under four different fertilizer regimes were modelled in response to weather (seasonal temperature and rainfall). The modelling approach applied comprised: (1) a Bayesian model comparison to model parametrically the heteroskedasticity in a gamma likelihood func\u0002tion; (2) a Bayesian varying intercept multiple regression model with an autoregressive lag one process (to incorporate the effect of productivity in the previous year) of the response of hay yield to weather from 1902 to 2016. The model confirmed that warmer and drier years, specifically, autumn, winter and spring, in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries reduced yield. The model was applied to forecast future spring hay yields at Park Grass under different climate change scenarios (HadGEM2 and GISS RCP 4.5 and 8.5). This application indicated that yields are forecast to decline further between 2020 and 2080, by as much as 48\u201350%. These projections are specific to Park Grass, but implied a severe reduction in grassland productivity in southern England with climate change during the twenty-first century. ",

Some 235 cDNA fragments representing potentially specific deficiency-induced genes were isolated and analysed. Reverse northern and northern blotting were utilized to eliminate false positive clones prior to promoter cloning. One of the 235 clones screened proved to be sufficiently specific to be useful as an S-deficiency marker. This gene, designated sdi1 (sulfur deficiency inducible), was highly specific in its expression to both field and laboratory-grown S-deficient plants. No expression could be detected under any other agronomically important nutrient deficient conditions tested (N, P, K and Mg). The gene showed a quantitative decrease in expression as external sulfate concentrations increased from 0 to 1 mM in laboratory-grown plants. Full length gene cloning showed that sdi1 consists of 1393 bp and encodes a protein of 315 amino acids.",

        "Comment": "Changes in global soil carbon stocks have considerable potential to influence the course of future climate change. However, a portion of soil organic carbon (SOC) has a very long residence time (>?100 years) and may not contribute significantly to terrestrial greenhouse gas emissions during the next century. The size of this persistent SOC reservoir is presumed to be large. Consequently, it is a key parameter required for the initialization of SOC dynamics in ecosystem and Earth system models, but there is considerable uncertainty in the methods used to quantify it. Thermal analysis methods provide cost-effective information on SOC thermal stability that has been shown to be qualitatively related to SOC biogeochemical stability. The objective of this work was to build the first quantitative thermal analysis based model of the size of the centennially persistent SOC pool. We used a unique set of soil samples from four agronomic experiments in Northwestern Europe with long-term bare fallow and non-bare fallow treatments (e.g. manure amendment, cropland and grassland), as a sample set for which estimating the size of the centennially persistent SOC pool is relatively straightforward. At each experimental site, we estimated the average concentration of centennially persistent SOC and its uncertainty by applying a Bayesian curve fitting method on the observed declining SOC concentration over the duration of the long-term bare fallow treatment. Overall, the estimated concentrations of centennially persistent SOC ranged from 5 to 11?gC.kg?1 soil (lowest and highest boundaries of four 95?% confidence intervals). Then, by dividing site-specific concentrations of persistent SOC by the total SOC concentration of 118 archived soil samples from long-term bare fallow and non-bare fallow treatments, we could estimate the proportion of centennially persistent SOC in the samples and the associated uncertainty. The proportion of centennially persistent SOC ranged from 0.14 (standard deviation of 0.01) to 1 (standard deviation of 0.15). Samples were subjected to thermal analysis by Rock-Eval 6 that generated a series of 30 parameters reflecting their SOC thermal stability and bulk chemistry. The sample set was split into a calibration set (n?=?88) and a validation set (n?=?30). We trained a non-parametric machine learning algorithm (random forests multivariate regression model) that accurately predicted the size of the centennially persistent SOC pool using Rock-Eval 6 thermal parameters as predictors in the calibration set (pseudo-R\u00b2?=?0.91, RMSEC?=?0.06) and the validation set (R\u00b2?=?0.91, RMSEP?=?0.07). The uncertainty of the predictions obtained using the multivariate regression model was quantified by a Monte Carlo approach that produced conservative 95% prediction intervals across the 30 samples of the validation set. This model based on Rock-Eval 6 thermal analysis can thus be used to predict the proportion of centennially persistent SOC with known uncertainty in new soil samples from similar pedoclimates. Our study strengthens the evidence for a link between the thermal and biogeochemical stability of soil organic matter, and demonstrates that Rock-Eval 6 thermal analysis can be used to quantify the size of the centennially persistent organic carbon pool in temperate soils.",

        "Comment": "A model of the void space of soil is presented, and used for the a priori biophysical simulation of denitrification. The model comprises a single critical percolation channel through a 5 cm stack of four unit cells of a dual-porous void structure. Together, the micro- and macro-porous structures closely replicate the full water retention characteristic of a sandy clay loam soil from the Woburn Experimental Farm operated by Rothamsted Research, UK. Between 1 and 10 micro-porous hot-spot zones of biological activity were positioned at equally spaced distances within 5 cm from the surface, and at either 10 ?m or 100 ?m from the critical percolation channel. Nitrification and denitrification reactions within the hotspots were assumed to follow Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics, with estimated values of rate coefficients. Estimates were also made of the threshold values of oxygen concentration below which the anaerobic processes would commence. The pore network was fully saturated following addition of an aqueous \u2018amendment\u2019 of nitrate and glucose which started the reactions, and which mirrored an established laboratory protocol. Diffusion coefficients for Fickian and Crank-Nicolson calculations were taken from the literature, and were corrected for the tortuosity of the micro-porosity. The model was used to show the amount of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and molecular nitrogen emerging from the simulated soil with time. Adjustment of the rate coefficient and oxygen threshold concentrations, within the context of a sensitivity analysis, gave emission curves in good agreement with previous experimental measurements. Positioning of the hot-spot zones away from the critical percolation path slowed the increase and decline in emission of the gases. The model and its parameters can now be used for modelling the effect of soil compaction and saturation on the emission of nitrous oxide.",

Between 1772 and 1876 the daily series is based on a sequence of single stations whose variance has been reduced to counter the artificial increase that results from sampling single locations. For subsequent years, the series has been produced from combinations of as few stations as can reliably represent central England in the manner defined by Manley. We have used the daily series to update Manley's published monthly series in a consistent way. We have evaluated recent urban warming influences at the chosen stations by comparison with nearby rural stations, and have corrected the series from 1974 onwards. The corrections do not (yet) exceed 0.1-degrees-C. We present all the monthly data from 1974, along with averages and standard deviations for 1961-1990. We also show sequences of daily central England temperature for sample years. All the daily data are available on request.",

        "Comment": "Plutonium and uranium isotope ratios can be used to differentiate the sources of nuclear contamination from nuclear weapon establishments (Environ. Sci. Technol. 34 (2000) 4496; Internal Report for AWRE Aldermaston, UK (1961)), weapon fallout (Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 51 (1987) 2623; Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 63 (1983) 202; Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 22 (1974) 111; Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 64 (2000) 989), reprocessing plants, reactor or satellite accidents (Science 105 (1979) 583; Science 238 (1987) 512) and in addition they provide markers for post-1952 geochronology of environmental systems. A good record of plutonium and uranium isotope ratios of the background resulting from atmospheric nuclear testing is essential for source characterisation studies. Using recently developed mass spectrometric techniques (J. Anal. At. Spectrom. 16 (2001) 279) we present here the first complete records between 1952 and the present day of northern temperate latitude Pu-240/Pu-239 and U-238/U-235 atom ratios for atmospheric deposition. Such information was not derived directly during the period of atmospheric testing because suitable mass spectrometric capability was not available. The currently derived records are based on an annual herbage archive and a core from an Alpine glacier. These studies reveal hitherto unseen fluctuations in the 238U/235U atmospheric fallout record, some of which are directly related to nuclear testing. In addition, they also provide the first evidence that plutonium contamination originating from Nevada Desert atmospheric weapon tests in 1952 and 1953 extended eastwards as far as northwestern Europe. The results presented here demonstrate that we now have the capability to detect and precisely identify sources of plutonium in the environment with implications for the development of atmospheric transport models, recent geochronology and environmental studies.

This research proposes a new method for predicting wheat grain yieldsthroughout the crop growth cycle based on canopy cover (CC) and reflectance indices, named Yieldp Model. The model was evaluated by comparing grain yields with the outputs of the proposed model using phenotypic data collected for a wheat population grown under field conditions for the 2015 and 2016 seasons. Accumulated radiation (RAD), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), Water Index (WI), Harvest Index (HI) and CC indices were the components of the model. We found that the biomass accumulation predicted by the model was responsive throughout the crop cycle and the grain yield predicted was correlated to measured grain yield. The model was able to early predict grain yield based on biomass accumulated at anthesis. Evaluation of the model components enabled an improved understanding of the main factors limiting yield formation throughout the crop cycle. The proposed Yieldp Model explores a new concept of yield modelling and can be the starting point for the development of cheap and robust, on-farm, yield prediction during the crop cycle.",

        "Comment": "Solvent insoluble ester-bound moieties, released after base treatment from an acidic andosolic forest soil A-horizon from Madeira, were sequentially extracted and analysed using gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The separation of all moieties released into several pH \"subfractions\" allowed the various products released to be studied in detail. The distributions obtained for 2-alkanols, diols, n-alkanols, n-alkanoic acids, omega-hydroxy acids, trihydroxy acids, dihydroxy diacids and phenolic acids indicate a suberin dominated origin of ester-related moieties in this andosolic soil A-horizon. However, a small contribution from plant cutins can not be ruled out completely. Besides plant biopolyesters, the detection of iso and anteiso alkanoic acids, together with short-chain di and omega-hydroxy acids suggests an additional bacterial-derived contribution. In addition to being attached to intact biopolyesters or molecules trapped in the insoluble organic macromolecular network present in soils, we suggest that hydroxy, n-alkanoic, aromatic and diacid moieties released upon base treatment of andosolic soils may occur as Al/Fe organic complexes.

        "Comment": "Abstract Understanding the phosphate oxygen isotope (?18O-PO4) composition of bedrock phosphate sources is becoming ever more important, especially in areas of soil research which use this isotope signature as a proxy for biological cycling of phosphorus (P). For many of these studies, obtaining a sample of the source bedrock or applied mineral fertiliser for isotope analysis is impossible; meaning there is now a demand for a comprehensive characterisation of global bedrock ?18O-PO4 to support this work. Here we compile ?18O-PO4 data from a wide range of global bedrocks, including 56 new values produced as part of this study and a comprehensive overview of those within the previously existing literature. We present ?18O-PO4 data from the range of major phosphatic lithologies alongside as much metadata for the samples as could be gathered. Much of the data comes from bedrocks of marine sedimentary origin (< 1 Ma = > +22\u2030, >\u00a0540\u00a0Ma = ? +12\u2030), but we also present data from bedrocks associated with guano (range: +19.5 to +15\u2030) and igneous deposits (range: +12 to \u20130.8\u2030), both of which have distinct ?18O-PO4 signatures due to their formation mechanisms. We show that where repeat measurements of the same formation have been undertaken, regardless of method or exact sample location, there is an average within formation error of \u00b1 1.25\u2030. This is important, as is constitutes a reasonable level of uncertainty for phosphorus cycling studies which need to estimate bedrock ?18O-PO4 composition based on the literature. In combination, this data set presents 284 ?18O-PO4 values from 56 countries; a comprehensive starting point for researchers interested in understanding bedrock end member ?18O-PO4.",

        "Comment": "Extensive knowledge about refractory biomacromolecules has been accumulating for 20 years. The components, characterized by a conspicuous resistance to drastic base and acid laboratory hydrolyses, also exhibit a relatively high resistance to degradation under natural conditions. These refractory biomacromolecules, identified in vascular plants and microalgae, probably play a major role in living organism protection, and they are thought to be important for organic matter sources, composition, and turnover in soils and sediments as well. In addition, some refractory macromolecules are formed in natural environments as the result of condensation/aromatization processes. This review is concerned with six families of refractory macromolecules: lignins, sporopollenins, aliphatic macromolecules (algaenans, cutans, suberans), tannins, black carbon, and proteins. The origin and composition of each family and its contribution to organic matter in soils and sediments are discussed, focusing on recent advances and on questions that are still pending.",

        "Comment": "A sensitivity analysis is critical for determining the relative importance of model parameters to their influence on the simulated outputs from a process-based model. In this study, a sensitivity analysis for the SPACSYS model, first published in Ecological Modelling (Wu, et al., 2007), was conducted with respect to changes in 61 input parameters and their influence on 27 output variables. Parameter sensitivity was conducted in a \u2018one at a time\u2019 manner and objectively assessed through a single statistical diagnostic (normalized root mean square deviation) which ranked parameters according to their influence of each output variable in turn. A winter wheat field experiment provided the case study data. Two sets of weather elements to represent different climatic conditions and four different soil types were specified, where results indicated little influence on these specifications for the identification of the most sensitive parameters. Soil conditions and management were found to affect the ranking of parameter sensitivities more strongly than weather conditions for the selected outputs. Parameters related to drainage were strongly influential for simulations of soil water dynamics, yield and biomass of wheat, runoff, and leaching from soil during individual and consecutive growing years. Wheat yield and biomass simulations were sensitive to the \u2018ammonium immobilised fraction\u2019 parameter that related to soil mineralization and immobilisation. Simulations of CO2 release from the soil and soil nutrient pool changes were most sensitive to external nutrient inputs and the process of denitrification, mineralization, and decomposition. This study provides important evidence of which SPACSYS parameters require the most care in their specification. Moving forward, this evidence can help direct efficient sampling and lab analyses for increased accuracy of such parameters. Results provide a useful reference for model users on which parameters are most influential for different simulation goals, which in turn provides better informed decision making for farmers and government policy alike.

        "Comment": "A sulphate deficiency-induced gene, sdi1, has been identified by cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis utilizing field-grown, nutrient-deficient wheat (Triticum aestivum var. Hereward). The expression of sdi1 was specifically induced in leaf and root tissues in response to sulphate deficiency, but was not induced by nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium or magnesium deficiency. Expression was also shown to increase in plant tissues as the external sulphate concentration in hydroponically grown plants was reduced from 1.0 to 0.0 mm. On this basis, sdi1 gene expression has potential as a sensitive indicator of sulphur nutritional status in wheat. Genome-walking techniques were used to clone the 2.7-kb region upstream of sdi1 from genomic DNA, revealing several cis-element motifs previously identified as being associated with sulphur responses in plants. The Arabidopsis thaliana gene most highly homologous to sdi1 is At5g48850, which was also demonstrated to be induced by sulphur deficiency, an observation confirmed by the analysis of microarray data available in the public domain. The expression of Atsdi1 was induced more rapidly than previously characterized sulphur-responsive genes in the period immediately following the transfer of plants to sulphur-deficient medium. Atsdi1 T-DNA 'knockout' mutants were shown to maintain higher tissue sulphate concentrations than wild-type plants under sulphur-limiting conditions, indicating a role in the utilization of stored sulphate under sulphur-deficient conditions. The structural features of the sdi1 gene and its application in the genetic determination of the sulphur nutritional status of wheat crops are discussed.",

        "Comment": "A mechanistic model is described that predicts the effects of changes to the environment on the growth, yield and maturity of lettuce. The model assumes that lettuce has structural and storage carbon pools. The storage pool is supplied by photosynthesis and depleted by respiratory losses and the conversion of assimilate to the structural pool. The model incorporated both instantaneous effects of temperature and CO2, and long term effects of thermal time on photosynthetic rate. The rate of structural dry-matter production was related to a simple temperature dependent partitioning coefficient. The model was calibrated on eight separate crops of lettuce and validated With independent data from seven sources. The validated model was then used to simulate changes in head weight and time to maturity with systematic changes in temperature (-2 to +5 degrees C in 1K steps) and carbon dioxide (350 to 700 ppm in 50 ppm steps) superimposed on baseline meteorological data from Rothamsted (1984-1995). These predicted that changes to temperature of up to +3 degrees C would reduce the production time from about 96 to 79 d for April plantings, and from 63 to 52 d for August plantings. Head weight would increase by approximately 32% with an increase in CO2 of from 350 to 700 ppm, whilst the magnitude of this response varied little with planting date. For any sowing date, increasing temperature was predicted to have little effect on final head weight, however, head weight was predicted to decrease with later transplanting. The potential effects of changes to climate on lettuce production are discussed.",

        "Comment": "Carabid beetles are major predators in agro-ecosystems. The composition of their communities within crop environments governs the pest control services they provide. An understudied aspect is the distribution of predacious carabid larvae in the soil. We used novel subterranean trapping with standard pitfall trapping, within a multi-crop rotation experiment, to assess the responses of above- and below-ground carabid communities to management practices. Crop and trap type significantly affected pooled carabid abundance with an interaction of the two, the highest numbers of carabids were caught in subterranean traps in barley under sown with grass. Trap type accounted for the most variance observed in carabid community composition, followed by crop. Tillage responses were only apparent at the species level for three of the eight species modelled. Responses to crop type varied by species. Most species had higher abundance in under-sown barley, than grass, wheat and barley. Crop differences were greater in the subterranean trap data. For predaceous larvae, standard pitfalls showed lowest abundances in under-sown barley, yet subterranean traps revealed abundances to be highest in this crop. Comprehensive estimation of ecosystem services should incorporate both above- and below-ground community appraisal, to inform appropriate management.",

        "Comment": "All strains of <i>Rhizobium</i> isolated from ineffective nodules on white clover (> 50 separate isolations) formed in metal-contaminated soils from a field experiment were demonstrated to be wholly ineffective in nitrogen fixation in plant infection tests on N-free nutrient agar. The plasmid profiles of these isolates were all very similar indicating a lack of genetic diversity in the population surviving in high concentrations of heavy metals. Isolates from comparable field plots of uncontaminated soil had a wide diversity of plasmid profiles. Inoculation of white clover at sowing with a large inoculum of effective <i>Rhizobium leguminosarum</i> bv. <i>trifolii</i> on metal contaminated soil resulted in effective N2-fixation. However, if the inoculated soils were held for 2 months in a moist condition before sowing with white clover, N2-fixation was not detected with inoculum doses of 107 cells pot?1 or less but was obvious where a very large inoculum of 1010 cells pot?1 was added. This indicates that white clover rhizobia are unable to survive (or at least unable to remain effective) in the presence of concentrations of heavy metals close to the current Commission of the European Communities guidelines for environmental protection. A rapid method of assessment of the toxic effects of pollutants on populations of Rhizobium spp is described.",

        "Comment": "Soil microbial communities contain the highest level of prokaryotic diversity of any environment, and metagenomic approaches involving the extraction of DNA from soil can improve our access to these communities. Most analyses of soil biodiversity and function assume that the DNA extracted represents the microbial community in the soil, but subsequent interpretations are limited by the DNA recovered from the soil. Unfortunately, extraction methods do not provide a uniform and unbiased subsample of metagenomic DNA, and as a consequence, accurate species distributions cannot be determined. Moreover, any bias will propagate errors in estimations of overall microbial diversity and may exclude some microbial classes from study and exploitation. To improve metagenomic approaches, investigate DNA extraction biases, and provide tools for assessing the relative abundances of different groups, we explored the biodiversity of the accessible community DNA by fractioning the metagenomic DNA as a function of (i) vertical soil sampling, (ii) density gradients (cell separation), (iii) cell lysis stringency, and (iv) DNA fragment size distribution. Each fraction had a unique genetic diversity, with different predominant and rare species (based on ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis [RISA] fingerprinting and phylochips). All fractions contributed to the number of bacterial groups uncovered in the metagenome, thus increasing the DNA pool for further applications. Indeed, we were able to access a more genetically diverse proportion of the metagenome (a gain of more than 80% compared to the best single extraction method), limit the predominance of a few genomes, and increase the species richness per sequencing effort. This work stresses the difference between extracted DNA pools and the currently inaccessible complete soil metagenome.",

        "Comment": "The accumulation of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) was measured on two sites on Rothamsted Farm that had been fenced off some 120 years ago and allowed to revert naturally to woodland. The sites had previously been arable for centuries. One had been chalked and was still calcareous; the other had never been chalked and the pH fell from 7.1 in 1883 to 4.4 in 1999. The acidic site (Geescroft wilderness) is now a deciduous wood, dominated by oak (Quercus robor); the calcareous site (Broadbalk wilderness) is now dominated by ash (Fraxinus excelsior), with sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) and hawthorn, (Craetagus monogyna) as major contributors. The acidic site gained 2.00 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) over the 118-year period (0.38 t in litter and soil to a depth of 69 cm, plus an estimated 1.62 t in trees and their roots); the corresponding gains of N were 22.2 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) (15.2 kg in the soil, plus 6.9 kg in trees and their roots). The calcareous site gained 3.39 t C ha(-1) year(-1) over the 120-year period (0.54 t in the soil, plus an estimated 2.85 t in trees and roots); for N the gains were 49.6 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) (36.8 kg in the soil, plus 12.8 kg in trees and roots). Trees have not been allowed to grow on an adjacent part of the calcareous site. There is now a little more C and N in the soil from this part than in the corresponding soil under woodland. We argue from our results that N was the primary factor limiting plant growth and hence accumulation of C during the early stages of regeneration in these woodlands. As soil organic N accumulates and the sites move towards N saturation, other factors become limiting. Per unit area of woodland, narrow strips; that is, wide, hedges with trees, are the most efficient way of sequestering C - provided that they are not short of N.",

        "Comment": "Yorkshire fog (<i>Holcus lanatus</i>), which belongs to the Poaceae family and is a close relative of the agronomic crop oat (<i>Avena sativa</i>), is a widely adaptable grass species that is able to grow on highly acidic soils with high levels of Al, but the mechanism underlying the high Al tolerance is unknown. Here, we characterized two accessions of <i>H.lanatus </i>collected from an acid plot (soil pH 3.6, HL-A) and a neutral plot (pH 7.1, HL-N) in terms of Al tolerance, organic acid anion secretion and related gene expression. In response to Al (pH 4.5), the HL-A roots secreted approximately twice as much malate as the HL-N roots, but there was no difference in citrate secretion. Cloning of the gene HlALMT1 responsible for malate secretion showed that the encoded amino acid sequence did not differ between two accessions, but the expression level in the outer cell layers of the HL-A roots was twice as high as in the HL-N roots. This difference was not due to the genomic copy number, but was due to the number of cis-acting elements for an Al-responsive transcription factor (HlART1) in the promoter region of HlALMT1, as demonstrated by both a yeast one-hybrid assay and a transient assay in tobacco protoplasts. Furthermore, introduction of HlALMT1 driven by the HL-A promoter into rice resulted in significantly more Al-induced malate secretion than introduction of HlALMT1 driven by the HL-N promoter. These findings indicate that the adaptation of H.lanatus to acidic soils may be achieved by increasing number of cis-acting elements for ART1 in the promoter region of the HlALMT1 gene, enhancing the expression of HlALMT1 and the secretion of malate.",

        "Comment": "Weeds represent a significant threat to crop yields and global food security. We analysed data on weed competition from the world's longest running agricultural experiment to ask whether potential yield losses from weeds have increased in response to management and environmental change since the advent of the Green Revolution in the 1960s. On plots where inorganic nitrogen fertiliser has been applied, potential yield losses from weeds have consistently increased since 1969. This was explained by a warming climate, measured as air temperature averaged over the growing season for the weeds, and a shift towards shorter crop cultivars. Weeds also reduced yield proportionally more on plots with higher rates of nitrogen which had higher yields when weeds were controlled; the relative benefit of herbicides was, therefore, proportional to potential crop yield. Reducing yield losses from weed competition is increasingly challenging because of the evolution of herbicide resistance. Our results demonstrate that weeds now represent a greater inherent threat to crop production than before the advent of herbicides and integrated, sustainable solutions to weed management are urgently needed to protect the high yield potential of modern crop genotypes.",

        "Comment": "Agricultural landscapes (rural landscapes, agrolandscapes) are territories shaped by agricultural production. They have enabled the development of human civilizations and are a cultural achievement. Peasants. farmers and agricultural enrerprises feed society. They have created agricultural landscapes for their business and habitats for their life. To understand transformation processes in agricultural landscapes, we analyse the history of agriculture with a special focus on Europe and Eurasia. Current agricultural landscapes in a crowded. globalized world are multifunctional, highly complex systems. They not only serve to produce food commodities and energy for the increasing and expanding urban population but also pmvide diverse ecosystem services and need to cater for the demands of the rural population. Curent agriculture is highly productive in wealthy countries, but due to high inputs it is also responsible for environmental problems such as water pollution and loss of biodiversity. Industrial-style agriculture in large fields has resulted in increased productivity but simplified the structure of landscapes and eliminated elements of nature and rural culture. Major problems that urgently need to be addessed include trends towards disrupting natural cycles in agricultural production, soil and water degradation. ageing populations in villages and the breakdown of rural infrasructure. Agricultural landscape research provides  analyses to understand these prccesses and helps elaborate sustainable scientific, technical and cultural solutions.\u0002",

        "Comment": "Agricultural soils, having been depicted of much of their native carbon stocks, have a significant CO2 sink capacity. Global estimates of this sink capacity are in the order of 20-30 Pg C over the next 50-100 years. Management practices to build hip soil C must increase the input of organic matter to soil and/or decrease soil organic matter decomposition rates. The most appropriate management practices to increase soil C vary regionally, dependent on both environmental and socioeconomic factors. In temperate regions, key strategies involve increasing cropping frequency and reducing bare fallow, increasing the use of perennial forages (including N-fixing species) in crop rotations, retaining crop residues and reducing or eliminating tillage (i.e. no-till). In North America and Europe, conversion of marginal arable land to permanent perennial vegetation, to protect fragile soils and landscapes and/or reduce agricultural surpluses, provides additional opportunities for C sequestration. In the tropics, increasing C inputs to soil through improving the fertility and productivity of cropland and pastures is essential. In exclusive systems with vegetated fallow periods (e.g. shifting cultivation), planted fallows and cover crops can increase C levels over the cropping cycle. Use of no-till, green manures and agroforestry are other beneficial practices. Overall, improving the productivity and sustainability of existing agricultural lands is crucial to help reduce the rate of new land clearing, from which large amounts of CO2 from biomass and soil are emitted to the atmosphere, Some regional analyses of soil C sequestration and sequestration potential have been performed, mainly for temperate industrialized countries. More are needed, especially for the tropics, to capture region-specific interactions between climate, soil and management resources that are lost in global level assessments. By itself C sequestration in agricultural soils can make only modest contributions (e.g. 3-6% of total fossil C emissions) to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. However, effective mitigation policies will not be based on any single 'magic bullet' solutions, but rather on many modest reductions which are economically efficient and which confer additional benefits to society. In this context, soil C sequestration is a significant mitigation option. Additional advantages of pursuing strategies to increase soil C are the added benefits of improved soil quality for improving agricultural productivity and sustainability.",

        "Comment": "Nitrate leaching from agricultural soils is a considerable environmental concern related to nitrogen (N) application, and in some countries N fertilizer application is regulated by legislation to reach environmental goals. Information about the change in nitrate leaching with changes in mineral N fertilizer rates is important under such conditions. The increase in nitrate leaching due to extra mineral N application near the economic optimal N application for crop production, called marginal nitrate leaching, depends on a number of factors like soil type, crop types, climatic conditions and N fertilization rates. In this study, we collected published experimental data from 44 site-years from Denmark and 31 site-years from other European countries (Germany, Sweden, UK) with measured nitrate leaching at increasing mineral N fertilizer rates. We focused on obtaining marginal nitrate leaching around optimal N rates based on available information from the different field experiments. The measured nitrate leaching varied from 3 to 92\u00a0kg\u00a0N\u00a0ha-1 in the Danish dataset. For the European data set, it varied from 1 to 124\u00a0kg\u00a0N\u00a0ha-1. The median and mean of the estimated marginal nitrate leaching at the optimal N rates were 17.0% and 20.5%, respectively, in the Danish dataset and 9.0% and 14.9%, respectively, in the European dataset. At the optimal N rate, a positive relationship was found between yearly nitrate leaching and marginal nitrate leaching. Both nitrate leaching and marginal nitrate leaching at the optimal N rate were positively correlated with precipitation during the hydrological year and winter periods, but not to any other environmental factors tested. There was no significant difference in either marginal nitrate leaching or nitrate leaching between growing spring cereals versus winter cereals. No significant effect of winter vegetation cover on marginal nitrate leaching was detected. Furthermore, the marginal nitrate leaching at the optimal N rate in the first year of the experiments with increasing N rates was significantly lower than the accumulated effect of two or more years with low or high N rates. Therefore, the long-term effects of N rates should be accounted for when estimating marginal nitrate leaching. The marginal nitrate leaching is highly variable between years and only a part of this variation was explained in this study. The positive correlation between marginal nitrate leaching and nitrate leaching at optimum N rates implies that cropping system and management factors reducing nitrate leaching also reduce the marginal nitrate leaching.",

It gives a brief summary of the origins of plant nutritional research, beginning with some data from Homer and the willow tree experiment of van Helmont, as well as the discovery of physiological processes by von Liebig, Lawes and Boussingault. The most profound long-term trials, like the Orto Botanico in Padova, the Linne Garden in Uppsala and the Broadbalk in Rothamsted are presented in the paper. The agronomic, educational and scientific benefits of the major Hungarian long-term trials are also discussed, from Westsik (1929) to Martonvasar and the National Plant Nutrition Trials (OMTK) set up in 1963. There is a list of experimental sites giving information on the most important recent long-term trial locations and their activities.",

        "Comment": "We compared the results of a long-term (65 years) experiment in a South African grassland with the world's longest-running ecological experiment, the Park Grass study at Rothamsted, U.K. The climate is warm and humid in South Africa and cool and temperate in England. The African grassland has been fertilized with two forms of nitrogen applied at four levels, phosphorus and lime in a crossed design in 96 plots. In 1951, about 84% of plant cover consisted of Themeda triandra, Tristachya leucothrix and Setaria nigrirostris. Currently, the dominant species are Panicum maximum, Setaria sphacelata and Eragrostis curvula, making up 71% of total biomass. As in the Park Grass experiment, we found a significant (additive) interaction effect on ANPP of nitrogen and phosphorus, and a (marginally significant) negative correlation between ANPP and species richness. Unlike the Park Grass experiment, there was no correlation between ANPP and species richness when pH was included as a covariate. There was also a significant negative effect of nitrogen amount and nitrogen form and a positive effect of lime on species richness and species diversity. Soil pH had an important effect on species richness. Liming was insufficient to balance the negative effects on species richness of nitrogen fertilization. There was a significant effect of pH on biomass of three abundant species. There were also significant effects of light on the biomass of four species, with only Panicum maximum having a negative response to light. In all of the abundant species, adding total species richness and ANPP to the model increased the amount of variance explained. The biomass of Eragrostis curvula and P. maximum were negatively correlated with species richness while three other abundant species increased with species richness, suggesting that competition and facilitation were active. Consistent with the results from the Park Grass and other long-term fertilization experiments of grasslands, we found a positive effect of soil pH and a negative effect of nitrogen amount on species richness, a more acutely negative effect on species richness of acidic ammonium sulphate fertilizer than limestone ammonium nitrate, a negative relationship between species richness and biomass, and a positive effect on species richness of lime interacting with nitrogen.",

        "Comment": "The potassium (K) and sodium (Na) requirements of sugar beet were re-examined in a 6-year series of experiments between 2000 and 2005 using reference plots with a wide range of long-established differences in exchangeable topsoil K (K,x). Two groups of plots with a topsoil concentration K(ex) range of 40-550 mg/kg were used, each situated within an individual field, one on a silty clay loam at Rothamsted and the other on a contrasting sandy loam at Woburn. The interactions between topsoil K(ex) and applied N, K and Na fertilizers were studied at Rothamsted. Under these well-defined conditions, maximum yields of 55-71 t/ha of adjusted clean beet were achieved with a topsoil K(ex) concentration of 120-150 mg/kg, i.e. at Soil K Index 2-, with a small difference between the two soils being accounted for by differences in exchangeable soil Na and subsoil K(ex). There were no yield responses to freshly applied fertilizer K, even on low K plots where responses might be expected. It is concluded that the existing recommendations for K fertilizer use on UK sugar beet do not need to be adjusted to allow for the higher yields of modern crops. There were no yield responses to NaCl fertilizer at any level of topsoil K(ex) at Rothamsted (where the soil contained 15-20 mg Na/kg), but yields were increased on low K(ex) plots at Woburn whose sandy loam contained only 5-10 mg Na/kg. The uptake of Na from the applied NaCl fertilizer was strongly influenced by the exchangeable K and Na status of the soil. On the low Na soil at Woburn, almost all of the applied Na was taken up by sugar beet grown on plots with low concentrations of topsoil K(ex) and half of it on plots with adequate concentrations of topsoil K(ex) compared with two-thirds and one-fifth, respectively, on the higher Na-content soil at Rothamsted. Plants partitioned 0.75 of their K and 0.95 of their Na to the shoot and the balance to the storage root. This pattern of distribution was consistent across sites, seasons and soil K supply. The physiological interactions between K and Na were studied by examining their millimolar concentrations in the tissue-water (mmol/kg) of the shoots and storage roots. The tissue-water concentrations of K in the shoot increased asymptotically with the concentration of K(ex) in the topsoil, and the increase in K concentration was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the tissue-water concentration of Na. Maximum concentrations of K in shoot tissue-water (and minimum concentrations of Na) were achieved when the topsoil contained a minimum of 200 mg K(ex)/kg. The optimal physiological tissue-water concentration of Na in shoots was estimated to be c. 90-100 mmol/kg; maintenance of this level required a minimum of 25 mg/kg of exchangeable Na in the topsoil. When not limited by soil K(ex), plants maintained a total tissue-water concentration of e. 300-350 mmol/kg of K + Na within the shoot. This was achieved with 80 mmol of Na and 230 mmol of K/kg of tissue water on the high Na-content soil at Rothamsted, and with 40 mmol of Na and 275 mmol of K/kg tissue water on the low-Na soil at Woburn. Significant correlations were established between measurements of beet K made ill the factory tarehouse and those made using standard laboratory chemical analyses and between factory estimates of the concentrations of K in the tissue-water of delivered beet and the topsoil K(ex). The uses of these relationships to estimate the off-takes of K in the harvested beet and provide feedback to growers on the K status of their soils, and the implications of the study for the use of K and Na fertilizers on UK sugar beet are discussed.",

        "Comment": "It is estimated that half the soil carbon globally is in the subsoil, but data are scarce. We updated estimates of subsoil organic carbon (OC) in England and Wales made by Bradley et al. (2005) using soil and land-use databases and compared the results  with other published data. We estimated that the soils of England and Wales contained 1633, 1143 and 506 Tg of OC at 0\u201330, 30\u2013100 and 100\u2013150 cm depths, respectively. Thus, half of the soil OC was found below 30 cm depth. Peat soils accounted for the largest proportion, containing 44% of all the OC below 30 cm despite their small areal extent, followed by brown soils, surface-water gley soils, ground-water gley soils and podzolic soils. Peat soils had more than 25% of their profile OC per unit area in the 100\u2013150 cm depth, whereas most other soils had <8% at this depth. The differences between soil types were consistent with differences in soil formation processes. Differences in depth distributions between land uses were small, but subsoil OC stocks in cultivated soils were generally smaller than in soils under grassland or other land uses. Data on subsoil OC stocks in the literature were scarce, but what there was broadly agreed with the findings of the above database exercise. There was little evidence by which to assess how subsoil OC stocks were changing over time.",

        "Comment": "Large losses of metals applied to soil in metal-contaminated sewage sludge have been reported. The potential pathways of loss, including lateral movement from treated plot areas, have not been examined. A field experiment, which started in 1942, was investigated to determine the amount of lateral movement of zinc, cadmium, copper, nickel, chromium and lead due to conventional cultivation processes. A two-dimensional \u2018dispersion\u2019 model (i.e. movement of soil due to cultivation) fitted well to the observed movement of metals, and gave coefficients for movement of 0\u00b724 and 0\u00b713 m2 per tillage operation in dimensions parallel or perpendicular to the direction of ploughing, respectively. For testing purposes, the model was used to predict the concentrations of metals in specific areas of a plot or average concentrations for whole plots at different points in time. The concentrations measured in soil samples agreed well with the predicted values. Finally, the model was also used to estimate the proportion of the metal load applied between 1942 and 1961 that remained in the 0\u201327 cm cultivated layer in 1985. About 80% was accounted for: this large recovery is of great relevance to the long-term disposal of metal-contaminated wastes to land. Detailed analyses of soil profile samples showed that approximately 1% of the metals applied had moved 3\u00b75 cm below the plough layer or less, but there was no evidence of accumulation of metals in deeper horizons down to 46 cm. These results are discussed in relation to the other potential losses of metals in the experiment.",

After about 180 years from the start of the first of the classical Rothamsted experiments in 1843, these experiments still maintains a consistent appeal for researchers and the interest on LTAEs is growing, as shown by the increasing number of papers dealing with long-term effect of agricultural practices, frequently considering topics, such as sustainability, environmental quality, species-adaptation impacts, that were never envisioned by the founders of classical LTAEs. However, these experiments have numerous constraints and weakness that have to be clearly understood and evaluated when using the data, especially for up-scaling or modelling purposes. Nevertheless, in our vision, the strengths and the opportunities of LTAEs are still overwhelming, particularly if connected in networks allowing a standardisation of procedures and facilitating the access to data and to the experiments of researchers external to the institution hosting the LTAE.

        "Comment": "The impact of interspecific competition is usually measured by its effect upon plant growth, neglecting impacts upon other stages of the life cycle such as fecundity which have a direct influence upon individual fitness and the asymptotic population growth rate of a population (lambda). We used parameterized matrix models for three perennial plant species grown with and without interspecific competition to illustrate how the methodology of Life Table Response Experiments (LTRE) can be used to link any change in population dynamics to changes in any part of the life cycle. Plants were herbaceous grassland species grown for two years in a field experiment at Rothamsted Experimental Station, England. Interspecific competition reduced X by over 90% in all species. Survival and growth were slightly affected by competition whereas plant fecundity was greatly reduced. Nearly all of the observed difference in X between the competition treatments was explained by the fecundity terms, and more precisely by a large difference in the number of seeds, and a high sensitivity of X to the germination rate. Whereas most competition studies focus on the measurement of change in individual fitness, our study illustrates how informative it is to take account not only of the effect of competition upon vital rates but also of how different vital rates affect population growth rate.",

        "Comment": "In many intensive agroecosystems continued inputs of phosphorus (P) over many years can significantly increase soil P concentrations and the risk of P loss to surface waters. For this study we used solid-state P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, highpower decoupling with magic angle spinning (HPDec-MAS) NMR, and cross polarization with magic angle spinning (CP-MAS) NMR to determine the chemical nature of potentially mobile P associated with aluminum (M) and calcium (Ca) in selected arable soils. Three soils with a range of bicarbonate-extractable Olsen P concentrations (40-102 mg P kg(-1)) were obtained from a long-term field experiment on continuous root crops at Rothamsted, UK, established in 1843 (sampled 1958). This soil has a threshold or change point at 59 mg Olsen P kg-1, above which potentially, mobile P (as determined by extraction with water or 0.01 M CaCl2) increases much more per unit increase in Olsen P than below this point. Results showed that CaCl2 and water preferentially extracted Al-P and Ca-P forms, respectively, from the soils. Comparison among the different soils also indicated that potentially mobile P above the threshold was largely present as a combination of soluble and loosely adsorbed (protonated-cross polarized) P forms largely associated with Ca, such as monetite (CaHPO4) and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (CaHPO4.2H(2)O), and some Al-associated P as wavellite. The finding, of this study demonstrate that solid-state NMR has the potential to provide accurate information on the chemical nature of soil P species and their potential mobility.",

        "Comment": "The analysis of the intrinsic properties and processes of ecosystems, which regulate the production stability of mixed grasslands, has been complicated by the environmental noise caused by stochastic weather fluctuations. A mathematical framework is presented to deduct the actual, the extrinsic and the intrinsic stability of grassland ecosystems, as defined in the companion paper, from their yield patterns and the environmental patterns during a long time-course. Intrinsically stable grassland ecosystems remain stable when subjected to structured environmental fluctuations, yet are destabilised by stochastic environmental fluctuations. Contrastingly, intrinsically oscillating grassland ecosystems are on average somewhat stabilised by stochastic environmental fluctuations in temperate climates. Structured environmental fluctuations may fully stabilise these systems in continental climates. However, in these climates these ecosystems are destabilised by stochastic environmental fluctuations. As in some cases the actual stability of yields may be higher in intrinsically oscillating systems than in intrinsically stable systems, the stability of yields observed in short-term experiments is a poor reflection of the intrinsic ecosystem properties. Subsequently, this mathematical framework is applied to a number of experimental ecosystems in the Park Grass Experiment (UK) and at the Ossekampen (The Netherlands), which were subjected to various fertiliser and lime applications, and to a regime of either cutting or grazing, respectively. In the Park Grass Experiment, the yields of all plots studied appeared to be extrinsically unstable, with only small differences between fertiliser treatments. However, plots receiving lime showed a higher extrinsic stability than unlined plots. The extrinsic stability of the plot receiving farmyard manure (FYM) was lower than that of the plot receiving an equivalent of mineral nitrogen. Also at the Ossekampen, only small differences arose between the extrinsic stability of plots receiving various fertiliser treatments. Instead, the grassland management of the plots had an overriding effect on these stability levels. Whereas the extrinsic stability of all cut plots was low, all grazed plots were nearly entirely stable. It is argued that the nitrogen dynamics in grassland ecosystems have only a small impact on their extrinsic stability levels, in spite of the predictions by simulation models. Instead, pH-related soil processes and the grassland management play an overriding role in the maintenance of the production stability of mixed grassland. It is conceivable that a large number of other processes, which regulate ecosystem stability, could be identified in other plots and experiments, using the same mathematical framework.

        "Comment": "Three assumptions underly safe inference from an analysis of variance of soil data from designed experiments and surveys. They are (a) that the residuals are normally distributed, (b) that the within-groups variances are equal and (c) that effects of treatments and blocks are additive. Small departures from these assumptions are unlikely to affect conclusions because the analysis is robust. Large departures could have serious consequences, however. The most common departures in the real world of the soil are strongly positively skewed distributions of the observed values, many of which are approximately lognormal. In those situations, transformation of the data to logarithms should lead to analyses from which inferences are sound and to confidence limits on estimates. Mean values can be transformed back to the original scales to aid understanding. Measurements of nitrogen in the soil of the Broadbalk wheat experiment show how transformations of the strongly skewed data to logarithms are sufficient to satisfy the assumptions underlying the analysis. Those of nitrogen in the soil of Cashmore Field at Silsoe required the somewhat more complex Box-Cox transformation to satisfy the assumptions and lead to sensible conclusions. The statistical distributions in pH, already a logarithm, in the soil in sandy drift and chalky boulder clay at Broom's Barn Farm differed so strongly that no transformation would satisfy the assumptions. Non-parametric tests are available, but they should be used only if no suitable transformation can be found. Highlights Safe inference from the analysis of variance is based on three conditions. The conditions are normal distribution of residuals, homogeneity of variances and additivity of effects. Most departures from the conditions in the real world of the soil are caused by positively skewed distributions. Transformation to logarithms will often deal with departures from these conditions.",

        "Comment": "Sound design for experiments on soil is based on two fundamental principles: replication and randomization. Replication enables investigators to detect and measure contrasts between treatments against the backdrop of natural variation. Random allocation of experimental treatments to units enables effects to be estimated without bias and hypotheses to be tested. For inferential tests of effects to be valid an analysis of variance (anova) of the experimental data must match exactly the experimental design. Completely randomized designs are usually inefficient. Blocking will usually increase precision, and its role must be recognized as a unique entry in an anova table. Factorial designs enable questions on two or more factors and their interactions to be answered  simultaneously, and split-plot designs may enable investigators to combine factors that require disparate amounts of land for each treatment. Each such design has its unique correct anova; no other anova will do. One outcome of an anova is a test of significance. If it turns out to be positive then the investigator may examine the contrasts between treatments to discover which themselves are significant. Those contrasts should have been ones in which the investigator was interested at the outset and which the experiment was designed to test. Post-hoc testing of all possible contrasts is deprecated as unsound, although the procedures may guide an investigator to further experimentation. Examples of the designs with simulated data and programs in GenStat and R for the analyses of variance are provided as File S1. ",

Holcus lanatus seeds and Puccinia coronata spores were collected from two adjacent and otherwise similar habitats with differing long-term N fertilization levels. After inoculation, disease and necrosis dynamics were observed during the plant growing seasons of 2003 and 2006. In both years high nutrient availability resulted in earlier disease onset, a higher pathogen population growth rate, earlier physiological apical leaf necrosis onset and a reduced time between disease onset and apical leaf necrosis onset. Necrosis rate was shown to be independent of nutrient availability. The results showed that in these nutrient-rich habitats H. lanatus plants adopted necrosis mechanisms which wasted more nutrients. There was some indication that these necrosis mechanisms were subject to local selection pressures, but these results were not conclusive. The findings of this study are consistent with apical leaf necrosis being an evolved defence mechanism.",

        "Comment": "The Park Grass Experiment at Rothamsted consists of a series of fertilizer treatments which have been applied to a species-rich hay meadow annually since 1856. Detailed botanical analyses of the plots between 1862 and 1992 were classified to one of the National Vegetation Classification (NVC) communities using the similarity measured by Czekanowski coefficient using computer program MATCH. Results indicated that ''control'' unfertilized plots were a relatively stable Cynosurus cristatus-Centaurea nigra dicotyledon-rich grassland. However mineral fertilized plots moved towards a species-rich Arrhenatherum elatius grassland MG1e after 50-80 years and remained there. Plots receiving nitrogen fertilizer moved first to MG1e then on to a Lolium perenne-Alopecurus pratensis grassland MG7D. Perhaps the most interesting plot was one which received a low rate of the soil acidifying ammonium sulphate fertilizer; the species composition changed towards a MG7D (Lolium perenne-Alopecurus pratensis) community between 1856 and 1903 but since then a liming treatment has been applied to part of the plot and the species composition on that part has recovered to a MG5 community resembling the control plots, taking 70-90 years to do so.",

        "Comment": "Achieving food security requires resilient agricultural systems with improved nutrient-use efficiency, optimized water and nutrient storage in soils, and reduced gaseous emissions. Success relies on understanding coupled nitrogen and carbon metabolism in soils, their associated influences on soil structure and the processes controlling nitrogen transformations at scales relevant to microbial activity. Here we show that the influence of organic matter on arable soil nitrogen transformations can be decoded by integrating metagenomic data with soil structural parameters. Our approach provides a mechanistic explanation of why organic matter is effective in reducing nitrous oxide losses while supporting system resilience. The relationship between organic carbon, soil-connected porosity and flow rates at scales relevant to microbes suggests that important increases in nutrient-use efficiency could be achieved at lower organic carbon stocks than currently envisaged.",

        "Comment": "1 The distribution of relative abundances between the species of a plant community has been remarkably little analysed. We examine differences in relative abundance distribution (RAD) between different soil fertility levels, and trends through time in the development of a community, using data from three grassland experiments: Monks Wood grassland restoration, Park Grass long-term fertilizer trial and Compton grassland restoration. 2 Comparing plots with different fertilizer treatments, the evenness of plant species abundance was higher where phosphorus had been applied; other effects of soil fertility on evenness were inconsistent. There were no consistent effects of soil fertility on the relative fit of the Geometric, General Lognormal and Zipf-Mandelbrot models of RAD, contrary to previous theories. However, the Broken Stick model fitted relatively better, though still poorly in absolute terms, in plots with high species richness and where phosphorus had been applied. Parameter ? of the General Log-normal distribution was higher in the high-nitrogen and species-poor plots, disproving the theory that ? should be constant. Parameter ? of the Zipf-Mandelbrot model was higher in more species-rich and in highphosphorus plots, a result not predicted in the literature. The variation in ? and ? seems to be largely a reflection of the variation in evenness and in species dominance. The consistency in species dominance across space (rank consistency) was higher in plots with phosphorus addition. It is concluded that resource availability had little effect on which model of community assembly fitted. However, under high phosphorus conditions the community was more spatially consistent, and there was less dominance. 3 Through time, the evenness of species abundances increased, consistently between two separate experiments. Examining the shape of the abundance distribution at a more detailed level, there were no time trends in which relative abundance model fitted best, except that the fit of the Broken Stick model became less poor. However, the shape of the General Log-normal and Zipf-Mandelbrot curves, as seen in indices ? and ?, respectively, changed through time, consistently between two separate experiments, supporting the implication from increased evenness of increasing niche diversification. Rank consistency increased in the early years of succession, then decreased, supporting the Three-phase succession model of Gitay & Wilson (1995), in which a middle 'building' phase has higher rank consistency than the preceding 'pioneer' phase or the succeeding 'mature' phase.",

        "Comment": "There have been suggestions that the population dynamics of weeds may show chaotic dynamics, and that therefore it will not be possible to predict the impact of changing management regimes on weed abundance. The instability of weed populations is presumed to result either from overcompensating yield-density responses or from threshold management. Using theoretical arguments and empirical evidence we argue that this contention is likely to be incorrect. Overcompensating yield-density responses are unlikely in plant populations and this point has been extensively discussed. Such responses have only been observed in high-density artificially sown stands of weed populations. The form of chaos that results from threshold management is a consequence of high population growth resulting from the cessation of management when weed densities are lower than a threshold level. Consequently the dynamics of such populations may be argued to be extrinsically rather than intrinsically driven.There are many studies that have shown weed populations to be dynamically stable, both spatially and temporally. Here we present an analysis of data from the Broadbalk experiment that demonstrates long-term stability of 12 species of common weeds over a 12-year period. Using parameter estimates derived from the literature we show that the stability of these populations is similar to other annual species, both weedy and non-weedy. We argue that weed population dynamics are more generally better viewed as resulting from the impacts of broad-scale types of management, as well as temporal variability in population numbers. The significance of chaotic dynamics is likely to be minimal.",

It is based on wheat grain quality analyses carried out on samples collected between 1850 and 2016. Samples were obtained from the Broadbalk Continuous Wheat Experiment (UK) and from herbaria from 16 different countries around the world. Our study showed that, together with an increase in carbohydrate content, an impoverishment of mineral composition and protein content occurred. The imbalance in carbohydrate/protein content was specially marked after the 1960's, coinciding with strong increases in ambient [CO2] and temperature and the introduction of progressively shorter straw varieties. The implications of altered crop physiology are discussed.",

        "Comment": "Laboratory spectroscopy has proved its reliability for estimating soil organic carbon (SOC) by exploiting the relationship between electromagnetic radiation and key spectral features of organic carbon located in the VIS-NIR-SWIR (350\u20132500 nm) region. While this approach provides SOC estimates at specific sampling points, geo-statistical or interpolation techniques are required to infer continuous spatial information. UAS-based proximal or remote sensing has the potential to provide detailed and spatially explicit spectral sampling of the topsoil at the field or even watershed scale. However, the factors affecting the quality of spectral acquisition under outdoor conditions need to be considered. In this study, we investigate the capabilities of two portable hyperspectral sensors (STS-VIS and STS-NIR), and two small-form multispectral cameras with narrow bands in the VIS-NIR region (Parrot Sequoia and Mini-MCA6), to predict SOC content. We collected spectral data under both controlled laboratory and outdoor conditions, with the latter being affected by variable illumination and atmospheric conditions and sensor-sample distance. We also analysed the transferability of the prediction models between different measurement setups by aligning spectra acquired under different conditions (laboratory and outdoor) or by different instruments. Our results indicate that UAS-compatible small-form sensors can be used to reliably estimate SOC. The results show that: (i) the best performance for SOC estimation under outdoor conditions was obtained using the VIS-NIR range, while the addition of the SWIR region decreased the prediction accuracy; (ii) prediction models using only the narrow bands of multispectral cameras gave similar or better performances than those using continuous spectra from the STS hyperspectral sensors; and (iii) when used in outdoor conditions, the micro hyperspectral sensors substantially benefitted from a laboratory model calibration followed by a spectral transfer using an internal soil standard. Based on this analysis, we recommend VIS-NIR portable instruments for estimating spatially distributed SOC data. The integration of these sensors in UAS-mapping devices could represent a cost-effective solution for soil research and precision farming applications when high resolution data are required.",

Critical Olsen-P for 95% maximum grain yield changed little between years and averaged 9 mg P/kg. Total-P and inorganic-P (Pi) were measured in whole shoots several times between late tillering and anthesis to see if Pi was a better indicator than total-P of the adequacy of P supply for maximum grain yield. Inorganic-P accumulated in shoot tissue water with increasing Olsen-P to a maximum concentration of c. 15 mM. Inorganic-P was a better indicator of crop P status as there was less variation in critical values between seasons and with crop growth stage. Expressing Pi concentrations on a tissue water basis (Piw) reduced the effect of differences in soil water supply and also offers the prospect of in situ testing. Over the three seasons, critical shoot Piw for 95% maximum grain yield averaged 4.7 mM (range 4.3-5.8 mM) during stem elongation.",

        "Comment": "The suitability of free-living N2-fixing bacteria as biological indicators for heavy metal toxicity in soil was assessed. The sensitivity of potential N2-fixation activity by cyanobacteria and aerobic heterotrophic bacteria were assessed using the acetylene reduction assay (ARA) on contaminated soils containing various concentrations of Zn, Cu, Ni, Cd, Cr and Pb. Soils from three long-term experiments (Woburn, Lee Valley, Luddington sites) were used which had previously been treated with metal-contaminated sewage sludge. A gradient of increasing heavy metal concentrations was made up by mixing uncontaminated and metal-contaminated Woburn soils. On the Woburn soils, concentrations of heavy metals in soil close to or below the current U.K. permissible limits (except for Cd which was greater than the limit) led to 94% inhibition of heterotrophic and up to 98% reduction of cyanobacterial N2-fixation activity. Heterotrophic activity was also strongly inhibited in the Lee Valley soils. On the other soils, little or no N2-fixation activity could be measured even in uncontaminated soils possibly due to low soil pH, the presence of mineralisable N in the soil, or absence of the microorganisms. Our results indicate that both methods are only of limited suitability for widespread use as biological indicators of metal toxicity. Assessment of heterotrophic N2-fixation is more promising in this respect than measurement of cyanobacterial activity, as results are obtained more easily and quickly.",

        "Comment": "Phosphorus (P) losses from soil to water by erosion and surface runoff have been much studied and quantified. However, P losses by leaching have received much less attention, mainly because, until recently, the quantities involved were not considered to be of environmental significance. Furthermore, P leaching losses, unlike P losses from erosion or surface runoff were not believed to be related to rates of P addition, as inorganic fertilizer or manures. Here we report results from a number of field and laboratory experiments, designed to assess the significance of P leaching losses from soil to water. Annual cumulative total P losses in drainage waters from four UK field sites ranged from about 0.03 to 5 kg P ha(-1) during 2001-2002. Molybdate reactive P ranged from 45-57%, soluble organic P from 10-13% and particulate P from 29-45% of total P on the two sites (Broadbalk and Woburn) where they could be accurately measured. The proportions of these different P forms were comparable in all treatments, including drainage waters from the unfertilised soils and soils receiving long-term applications of farmyard manure or inorganic fertilizer. In all soils, there was indication of an Olsen- (0.5 M NaHCO3-, pH 8.5) extractable P concentration, (termed the Change-Point), where P measured in field drainage waters or in laboratory soil extracts of 0.01 M CaCl2 began to increase linearly as Olsen-P increased. There was also some agreement between drainage water-P or CaCl2-P and the Olsen-P concentration where the Change-Point occurred. This suggests that CaCl2-extractable P may provide an approximate indicator of soil P concentrations above which significant quantities of P may be lost by leaching under field conditions. There were positive linear relationships between soil dithionate-extractable A] and soil organic C with the Change-Point: [Change Point = [(0.049)[Al3+] minus (9.2)(% organic C)] accounting for 93% of the variance in the data. If this relationship holds under further testing it could well be a useful predictor of Change-Points in different soils. Phosphate sorption isotherms were used to study the soil P concentrations above which P was at risk of moving from soil to water. They showed that soil solution P concentrations were significantly lower between pH 6.9-7.2 than between pH 7.7-8.1, with implications for P loss from soil to water.",

        "Comment": "Crop quality and marketability often reflect the uniformity of growth within a field and uniform crops often use inputs very efficiently and speed harvest. Within-field variation in growth and yield has long been recognised. In the past it has been measured at considerable cost. Frequently, considerable variation was observed between years and crops in the position of high and low yielding areas. Thus seeking the causes of yield variation was difficult, and even if identified, varying husbandry practices to allow for variable yields was too complicated in practice. The introduction of fully automatic and integrated yield mapping systems can now generate information showing the variation in crop performance and yield within individual fields and this now adds a new dimension to the management opportunities for arable agriculture. These new opportunities for precision farming, defined here as spatially variable management within a field, will allow more efficient use of inputs, greater profitability and more environmentally benign husbandry. But optimising the opportunities now available will require that the causes of yield variation are ascertained and appropriate remedial measures are available. Yield variation can be caused by within-field differences in any of those factors which contribute to the biological, chemical and physical properties of soil and ascertaining the effect of these factors is often made more difficult because they interact one with another. Biological factors are not discussed here but some chemical and physical soil parameters are. Many of these factors which affect yield act through their effects on water and nutrient acquisition by plant roots. Examples of some critical values for soil parameters are given and related to the distribution and function of roots.",

Structural analyses using synchrotron-based X-ray near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) on humic substance extracts of archived samples from the Rothamsted Park Grass Experiment reveal a significant (R-2 = -0.58; P < 0.05; N = 7) shift in soil organic sulfur (S) forms, from reduced to more oxidized organic S between 1876 and 1981, even though soil total S contents remained relatively constant. Over the last 30 years, a decrease in emissions and consequent S deposition has again corresponded with a change of organic S structures of humic extracts-reverting in the direction of their early industrial composition. However, the observed reversal lagged behind reductions in emissions by 19 years, which was computed using cross correlations between time series data (R-2 = 0.66; P = 0.0024; N = 11). Presently, the ratio of oxidized-to-reduced organic S in humic substance extracts is nearly double that of early industrial times at identical SO2 emission loads. The significant and persistent structural changes of organic S in humic substances as a response to SO2 emissions and S deposition may have effects on recuperation of soils and surface waters from acidification.",

Small amounts of 'residual' N-15 were recovered in the following two spring barley crops; 8% in the first and 3% in the second. The overall loss of 'residual' N-15 (i.e. 'residual' N-15 not recovered in crops and soil to a depth of 70 cm) over the 2 years was 23%. This is equivalent to just 8% of the total N-15 originally applied. There was surprisingly little difference in the behaviour of the 'residual' N-15 in soils containing very different quantities of soil organic matter.",

        "Comment": "With more than 160 years of contrasting fertilizer regimes, the Broadbalk winter wheat experiment represents a unique experimental resource for studying the effects of long-term fertilizer application on microbial population diversity. Using DGGE and clone library analysis, we report here on eubacterial species diversity (16S rRNA gene) and diversity within two sets of gene products associated with microbial N acquisition: NifH (nitrogen fixation) and AmtB (ammonium transport). Comparisons were made within and between soils treated with mineral N fertilizer, farmyard manure or receiving no fertilizer. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene DGGE profiles showed no clear patterns to qualitatively distinguish bacterial community structure between the three different treatments (P > 0.05), with all samples containing a range of eubacterial taxa similar to those that are characteristic of soil bacteria reported elsewhere. Intra-plot heterogeneity was high and of a similar magnitude to that between treatments. This lack of qualitative between plot differences was echoed in the representative sequences of 16S rRNA, nifH, and amtB genes in the various samples. Taken together, both phylogenetic and functional gene analyses showed bacterial communities in the Broadbalk-trial soil were very stable and relatively non-responsive to long-term management of balanced fertilizer inputs.",

        "Comment": "Endophytic bacteria are non-pathogenic and occur in the internal tissue of healthy plants. They often provide benefits for the host, including growth promotion, bio-fertilisation and bio-control. Endophytic bacteria in agricultural crops thus present an exciting field with the potential to improve productivity, disease control and food security. This project focusses on endophytic bacteria in winter wheat. Firstly, an optimised isolation method was developed and used to isolate a library of 804 endophytes from wheat grown under six fertiliser conditions in the Broadbalk Experiment at Rothamsted Research in the UK. The effects of growth stage, tissue type and fertiliser inputs were investigated. In summary, endophyte abundance was higher in roots than leaves and tissue type significantly affected phylum abundance: Proteobacteria dominated in the roots, whereas Firmicutes and Actinobacteria dominated in the leaves. Growth stage was found to affect the endophyte community structure at the genus level. Regarding fertiliser treatment, a higher abundance of endophytes was found in the plot without fertiliser, a trend not found for free-living soil bacteria. Fertiliser had no effect on phylum distribution in the roots but there were distinctions at the genus level. These results indicate that tissue type and the plant growth response to fertiliser inputs are the main drivers of endophytic community structure. Secondly, endophyte transmission in seeds was investigated. In wheat seeds the bacterial load was significantly reduced or eliminated by growing surface sterilised excised embryos. Seedlings obtained with this method were used in re-inoculation experiments to confirm endophytic competency and to screen for plant growth promotion. Thirdly, Gram-negative endophytic isolates were transformed with marker proteins such as green fluorescent protein. These transformed strains are available for visualisation in planta. Together, these results expand our knowledge of endophyte distributions in wheat, the determination of community structure, the transmission of endophytes, and endophyte niche occupancy. The findings will help facilitate the development of endophytes as beneficial applications in agriculture.",

        "Comment": "The coexistence of many plant species competing for a few resources is one of the central puzzles of community ecology. One explanation is that different species may be competitively superior in different microhabitats. Many species could then coexist within each piece of a mosaic landscape by what has been termed \"mass effects,\" because subpopulations in areas with negative growth rates would be supplemented by propagules from areas with reproductive surpluses. If mass effects are important, plant species diversity should increase near habitat boundaries, especially where habitat differences are moderate. In the first experimental test of this prediction, plants were censused on 54 transects within the long-established Rothamsted Park Grass plots. Very few showed significant declines in species richness with distance from subplot boundaries. Nonetheless, the regression coefficients were negative much more often than expected by chance, suggesting that weak mass effects operated. The effect was strongest where neighboring subplots differed greatly, with no evidence of the predicted decline where differences were extreme. Detailed analyses of transects with apparent mass effects revealed few species that behaved as predicted. This study serves both to provide evidence of the existence of mass effects and to question their importance in the maintenance of local plant diversity in this system.",

        "Comment": "Background and aims: Increasing the concentrations of the essential micronutrient Zn in staple crops like grain is desirable for human nutrition. We investigated the long-term ability of municipal treatment works sewage sludge, liquid sewage sludge and ZnCO3 applied to soils to increase Zn in wheat grain (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) in a number of field experiments conducted on different soils. Methods: We used six long-term field experiments that were set up on contrasting soils in England and the target applications were built up between 1994 and 1997. Topsoil samples and harvested grain samples were taken and air dried in 1999, 2001, 2003 and 2005. Relationships between grain Zn concentrations and soil properties and changes with time were examined. Results: Wheat grain Zn concentrations increased with soil Zn concentrations in a similar log-log relationship with all of the Zn sources tested. Comparing total or extractable Zn in soil as explanatory factors showed little benefit of using extractable Zn measurements to predict grain concentrations over total Zn. Additional factors such as soil pH or organic carbon did not explain much more of the variation in grain Zn in our experiments. However, grain Zn concentrations did not respond at all at a site with pH 7.7. Conclusions: Sewage sludge applications to soil can increase grain Zn concentrations for at least 2 to 8 years after application and has similar effectiveness to ZnCO3.",

        "Comment": "This dataset contains scores of Brown Foot Rot (BFR) caused by Fusarium spp., from the Broadbalk wheat experiment, with associated grain yield at harvest, 1992-2009. BFR infection varied a lot from year to year, possibly due to variation in winter and spring temperature and rainfall. Infection was greatest in 3rd wheats and continuous wheat, and least in 1st wheats. Fertilizer application rates influenced infection, with the lowest rates in plots where one or more nutrients was missing (plots 10 and 11). The plots treated with the most nitrogen (plots 15 and 21) had the highest BFR scores, as also reported for Broadbalk by Glynne (1969) and in dilution plating studies by Bateman and Coskun (1995) and Snyder and Nash (1968).",

        "Comment": "The relationships between bryophyte biomass and species richness and soil pH, nutrient applications and vascular plant biomass and species richness were analysed for the Park Grass Experiment (Rothamsted, UK). The study examined the abundance of bryophytes in relation to long-term fertilizer and lime application and to fertilizer treatments recently being ceased on some plots. The probability of bryophytes being present on a plot increased with increasing soil pH, and on plots at soil pH 3.3-4.5, the lowest values in this experiment, there were virtually no mosses present. Total bryophyte biomass decreased with increasing vascular plant biomass and vascular plant richness. Both bryophyte biomass and species richness showed a curvilinear response to soil pH. Bryophyte biomass was markedly increased on plots where nitrogen (N) fertilization had recently been ceased. The abundance of the common bryophyte species showed individualistic responses to treatments. N had a negative effect on the abundance of Brachythecium rutabulum. Increasing soil pH, and the application of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fertilizer together, had a positive effect on Eurhynchium praelongum. This species was also negatively affected by N, but tolerated larger amounts of it (100-150 kg ha-1 N) than B. rutabulum. An ephemeral moss, Bryum subapiculatum, had a unimodal response to soil pH but showed no response to N, P, K or other explanatory variables.",

        "Comment": "Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained for solid samples of whole soils from three long-term field sites at Rothamsted Experimental Station, UK. In all sites, soil organic matter content was either increasing or decreasing due to contrasted long-continued treatments. Two soils were from Highfield, one from under old grassland (47 g organic C kg(-1)) and one from an area kept as bare fallow following ploughing of grass 21 years previously (14 g organic C kg(-1)). Three soils were taken from Broadbalk, two from plots within the Broadbalk Continuous Wheat Experiment which had received no fertilizer or animal manure annually for 148 years (7 and 27 g organic C kg(- 1), respectively) and one from Broadbalk Wilderness, wooded section (38 g organic C kg(-1)). Broadbalk Wilderness was arable until 1881 and has reverted to deciduous woodland in the subsequent 110 years. Two soils were from Geescroft, one from an arable field (9 g organic C kg(-1)) and one from Geescroft Wilderness (35 g organic C kg(-1)) which began reversion to deciduous woodland at the same time as Broadbalk Wilderness but is now acid (pH = 4.2) in contrast to Broadbalk which is calcareous (pH = 7.3). Solid-state C-13 NMR spectra were obtained on a 300-MHz instrument using cross polarization (CP) and magic angle spinning (MAS). All samples exhibited peaks in the following spectral regions: 0-45 ppm (alkyl), 45-60 ppm (methoxyl, carbohydrate and derivatives), 60-110 ppm (carbohydrates and derivatives, C-alpha of peptides), 110-160 ppm (aromatics) and 160-185 ppm (carboxyl groups and derivatives). Within the spectrum of a specific sample it was not possible to determine the relative proportions of soil organic carbon in the different forms identified because a range of factors can potentially alter the relative areas of peaks in different regions of the spectrum. However, from a comparison of relative peak areas within a set of soils from a given site, differing only in organic matter content, information can be deduced regarding the forms of C that are more or less subject to change in response to land use or management. At all sites carbohydrate C appears to be the form that is most subject to change, suggesting that it is an 'active' fraction compared with the other forms. It was greatest where organic matter inputs were greatest (due to inputs of farmyard manure or reversion to woodland) and declined relative to other forms following ploughing of old grassland. Alkyl C increased as total C accumulated but did not decline relative to other forms following ploughing of grass. One reason for the non-quantitative nature of the soil C-13 CPMAS spectra was a short (approximately 1 ms) component of the rotating-frame T-1 relaxation time for H nuclei (T-1 rho H). This problem was not overcome by acquiring data at -60 degrees C. In principle, solid-state spectra of soils obtained by direct polarization (i.e. without CP) might produce quantitative results, but the low C content of most mineral soils (10-50 g C kg(-1)) precludes this, given current instrumentation.",

        "Comment": "Agricultural land management, such as fertilization, liming, and tillage affects soil properties, including pH, organic matter content, nitrification rates, and the microbial community. Three different study sites were used to identify microorganisms that correlate with agricultural land use and to determine which factors regulate the relative abundance of the microbial signatures of the agricultural land use. The three sites included in this study are the Broadbalk Experiment at Rothamsted Research, UK, the Everglades Agricultural Area, Florida, USA, and the Kellogg Biological Station, Michigan, USA. The effects of agricultural management on the abundance and diversity of bacteria and archaea were determined using high throughput, barcoded 16S rRNA sequencing. In addition, the relative abundance of these organisms was correlated with soil features. Two groups of microorganisms involved in nitrogen cycle were highly correlated with land use at all three sites. The ammonia oxidizing-archaea, dominated by Ca. Nitrososphaera, were positively correlated with agriculture while a ubiquitous group of soil bacteria closely related to the diazotrophic symbiont, Bradyrhizoblurn, was negatively correlated with agricultural management. Analysis of successional plots showed that the abundance of ammonia oxidizing-archaea declined and the abundance of bradyrhizobia increased with time away from agriculture. This observation suggests that the effect of agriculture on the relative abundance of these genera is reversible. Soil pH and NH3 concentrations were positively correlated with archaeal abundance but negatively correlated with the abundance of Bradyrhizobium. The high correlations of Ca. Nitrososphaera and Bradyrhizobiurn abundances with agricultural management at three long-term experiments with different edaphoclimatic conditions allowed us to suggest these two genera as signature microorganisms for agricultural land use.",

        "Comment": "The capacity to accumulate cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) was compared in Thlaspi goesingense and four populations of Thlaspi caerulescens. Two populations of T. caerulescens were grown in hydroponics at five concentrations of Cd. In addition, plants were grown in pots containing compost in which three different concentrations of Cd and two concentrations of Zn were added. A field trial was conducted to compare Zn and Cd uptake by three populations of T. caerulescens on nine selected plots of the Woburn Market Garden Experiment (UK) which had been contaminated to different degrees with heavy metals owing to past applications of sewage sludge. Results show that the four populations of T. caerulescens had the same ability to hyperaccumulate Zn but were significantly different in terms of Cd accumulation. Two populations of T. caerulescens from Southern France accumulated much more Cd than the populations from Prayon (Belgium) and Whitesike (UK). Generally, uptake of Cd was not decreased by increased concentrations of Zn in the substrate. These results indicate that the mechanisms of Cd and Zn hyperaccumulation are not identical in this species. This is the first report of hyperaccumulation of Cd by T. goesingense, but the growth of this species was markedly reduced by the large concentrations of Zn in the substrate. Future work should focus on the differences between Cd and Zn uptake in hyperaccumulator plants at the species and population level.",

        "Comment": "A simple, sensitive method developed for the analysis of geostandards was used to measure the accumulation of Cd in soils from superphosphate applied annually to grassland and arable soils for many years. Rates of application were equivalent to 33 kg P and 5 g Cd ha-1 yr-1 for 95 yr in three experiments in England and to 37 kg P and 20 g Cd ha-1 yr-1 for 30 yr in one experiment in New Zealand. Very little Cd accumulated in the surface horizons (0-22.5 cm) of either of the arable soils from England; about one-quarter of the applied Cd was detected in the sub-soil (22.5-45.0 cm) of one experiment (Broadbalk) but none in the second (Barnfield). About one-half of the applied Cd was retained in the 0-22.5 cm horizon of grassland soils from both England and New Zealand. The light (< 2.2 g cm-3) organic-rich fraction of Park Grass soil from England contained about three times as much Cd as the heavier, mineral-rich fraction. This suggests that when Cd is incorporated into organic matter its mobility is decreased and soil pH then has smaller effects on its mobility. Uptake of Cd by grass-clover pasture in New Zealand averaged only 0.4 g Cd ha-1 yr-1 or 2% of the amount applied.",

        "Comment": "The mechanisms by which microbial communities maintain functions within the context of changing environments are key to a wide variety of environmental processes. In soil, these mechanisms support fertility. Genes associated with hydrolysis of organic phosphoesters represent an interesting set of genes with which to study maintenance of function in microbiomes. Here, we shown that the richness of ecotypes for each gene varies considerably in response to application of manure and various inorganic fertilizer combinations. We show, at unprecedented phylogenetic resolution, that phylogenetic diversity of phosphohydrolase genes are more responsive to soil management and edaphic factors than the taxonomic biomarker 16S rRNA gene. Available phosphorus \u2013 assessed by measuring Olsen-P - exerted some influence on alkaline phosphatase distribution: however, consistent and significant differences were observed in gene abundance between treatments that were inconsistent with bioavailable orthophosphate being the dominant factor determining gene abundance. Instead, we observed gene niche separation which was most strongly associated with soil exchangeable calcium. Our study suggests that the bioavailability of enzyme cofactors (exchangeable calcium in the case of phoD, phoX and ?PPhy  studied here) influence the abundance of genes in soil microbial communities; in the absence of cofactors, genes coding for alternative enzyme families that do not require the limiting cofactor (for example, non-specific acid phosphatases which require vanadate) become more abundant.",

        "Comment": "Soil samples collected from four of the Rothamsted long-term field experiments over the last 100 yr were used to follow the effects of management on soil organic matter content. The experimental sites were: Broadbalk and Geescroft Wildernesses, both on old arable land that had been fenced off in the early 1880s and allowed to revert naturally to deciduous woodland; the unmanured plot in the Rothamstead Park Grass continuous Hay Experiment, started in 1856; the unmanured and one of the NPK plots in the Broadbalk Continuous Wheat Experiment started in 1843. Total C, radiocarbon and (in some cases) soil microbial biomass C were measured in stored and contemporary soil samples. The current Rothamsted model for the turnover of organic C in soil was then used to calculate how the organic C content of the topsoils from the four sites would change with time for a range of annual inputs. The inputs that generated the best fit to the measured values were: Broadbalk Wilderness 3.5 t C/ha per yr, Geescroft Wilderness 2.5 t C/ha per yr; unmanured plot on Park Grass 3.0 t C/ha per yr; unmanured plot on Broadbalk Wheat 1.3 t C/ha per yr; NPK plot on Broadbalk Wheat 1.7 t C/ha per yr. The quantities of soil microbial biomass (measured by fumigation-incubation) in the top 23 cm of soil from the four sites were: Broadbalk Wilderness, 1.57 t C/ha; Geescroft Wilderness, 0.58 t C/ha; unmanured plot on Park Grass, 1.62 t C/ha, unmanured plot on Broadbalk Wheat, 0.47 t C/ha; NPK plot on Broadbalk Wheat, 0.76 t C/ha. The values for soil microbial C generated by the model for the above annual inputs agreed closely (with one exception) with the measured values. For a site under steady-state conditions, the annual input of organic matter to the soil plus the annual removal of organic matter from the site (if any) gives the Net Primary Production (NPP). NPP thus calculated was 4.0 t C/ha per yr for the unmanured plot on Park Grass, 2.2 for the unmanured plot on Broadbalk and 5.2 for the NPK plot on Broadbalk. The two Wilderness sites are still accumulating C in both soil and vegetation and here NPP is given by annual input to the soil, plus the annual increment of C in the trees. NPP calculated in this way was 4.8 t C/ha per yr for Broadbalk Wilderness and 3.3 for Geescroft Wilderness.",

        "Comment": "As the world population continues to increase so will the demand for food which, for the foreseeable future, will be based on growing crops in soil. Thus, a fertile soil is one of the world\u2019s most precious assets, and maintaining the soil\u2019s productive capacity is essential if humankind is to continue to exist. Yet, experience shows that globally, through ignorance or greed, large areas of productive soils are being lost to urban growth and its infrastructure, or to soil degradation or erosion. At the same time, the need to produce food at almost any cost, as in Europe at the end of World War II, is being replaced by the concepts of sustainability and environmental stewardship of the landscape and land used for agriculture in particular. In England, where soil and topography are suitable, the land is managed for agriculture, but increasing specialization has resulted in arable crop production in the drier eastern half of the country with animal husbandry on the wetter, western side and this has had an impact on the visual appearance of the landscape. However, whether growing arable crops or grass, optimum production requires the best possible soil conditions where the biological, chemical and physical properties of the soil are maintained at their optimum levels by appropriate management practices. Changes in cropping and management can be needed for economic, environmental or policy reasons, but it is not always possible to know what the effects of any change might be. They can be beneficial like accumulating soil organic matter to benefit soil structure and thus the ability of plant roots to efficiently explore the soil to find plant nutrients, or catastrophic like the adverse effects on crop yields from the build-up of soil borne pests and diseases. Experience shows, and we give examples here, of both beneficial and adverse effects from changes in agricultural practice, but to identify both required long-term field experiments as we show for changes in soil organic matter and the acidity of soil.",

        "Comment": "A recent paper Badgley et al. (2007) claimed that organic farming, if used worldwide, would provide sufficient food for a growing world population. The paper stimulated much critical response. Our paper makes a critical assessment of this claim for wheat, a major cereal crop and source of food throughout the world. We consider the problems of using experimental yields in estimating the productivity of any crop or farming system and then look at farm yields, comparing organic and conventional systems. We examine in detail at the comparisons made by Badgley et al. and find many of them unsupportable: the ratio of organic:conventional wheat yields of 0.85 proposed by Badgley et al. we believe to be closer to 0.65. Nitrogen (N) fixation by legumes, the main source of N supply in organic systems, is shown to be much too small and variable to support large and consistent wheat yields of acceptable quality, and ideas that cereals could one day fix their own N found wanting. Our conclusion therefore contradicts that of Badgley et al. but agrees with that of a recent report by the University of Reading's Centre for Agricultural Strategy (Jones and Crane, 2009) that organic agriculture cannot feed the world using current technologies and with the meat-rich diet that people have or aspire to. We do, though, agree with Badgley et al.'s view that there is a need to improve soil quality by adding organic material, reducing over-optimal use of fertilisers and agricultural chemicals, and optimising rotations to reduce losses to pests and diseases. There is also, perhaps, a wider societal need for people to reconsider diet in the context of their health and the ability of the world to supply the wants of its anticipated 9 billion population.",

        "Comment": "Understanding how plant species with similar resource requirements co-exist has been a long-standing ecological question with several theoretical explanations. One potential mechanism is the storage effect hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, species co-exist because they differ in when they are most actively using resource and, therefore, respond differently to environmental perturbation. The hypothesis is based on two main assumptions: (i) two competitors have different responses to climate and (ii) the responses to climate are mediated by changes in the relative importance of intra- and interspecific competition. The hypothesis could provide useful insights into the role of climate in  maintaining weed species diversity and potential shifts in dominant species under climate change. This study tested the basic principles of the storage effect hypothesis on weed communities using data from the Broadbalk longterm fertiliser experiment. Relative abundance of weeds in 10 plots with contrasting fertility but no herbicides was assessed for 21 years. Multivariate analyses and generalised additive mixed models were used to analyse the data. The following pairs of species were found to be adapted to similar fertiliser levels, but diverged in their response to climate: (i) Papaver rhoeas\u2013Tripleurospermum inodorum, (ii) Medicago lupulina\u2013Vicia sativa and (iii) Scandix pectenveneris\u2013Ranunculus arvensis. Contrasting responses to spring temperature within these species pairs modified the competition balance providing evidence for the storage effect hypothesis and helping to explain weed co-existence in the Broadbalk experiment.",

We provide a summary of existing experimental and modeling evidence for the potential that cropland soils in the Pacific Northwest have for sequestering organic carbon, and identify remaining knowledge gaps. The purpose of this summary is to provide context for regional policy discussions intent on fostering farming practices that show the best potential for carbon sequestration. We review regional research on the impacts of agricultural management strategies on carbon sequestration, including tillage, crop rotation, fallowing, perennial crops, crop fertilization, soil amendments, reduced burning, and reduced erosion. Our summary suggests that a number of practices can provide real but modest contributions to carbon sequestration. The opportunities to build soil organic carbon are greater in annually cropped systems with higher productivity, though the benefits of particular management practices are variable and depend on multiple environmental and physical conditions. Therefore, there is a need to establish credible estimates of carbon fluxes for Northwest agricultural systems. These estimates must also be accompanied by monitoring to determine whether cropland soils are achieving carbon sequestration goals. Thoughtful consideration of the environmental and production contexts surrounding Pacific Northwest agriculture, combined with targeted research to identify the most effective carbon sequestration practices, could lead to the development of policies that can realize the real contributions that croplands in the Pacific Northwest can make to climate change mitigation efforts.",

        "Comment": "Determining the drivers underlying ecological succession is essential for predicting ecosystem functioning in response to human-induced environmental changes. Although various studies have examined the impacts of nitrogen (N) addition on plant and microbial community diversity, structure and activities, it remains unknown how long-term anthropogenic fertilization affects the ecological succession of microbial functional guilds and its underlying community assembly mechanisms. Here, using archived soils, we examined more than a century's succession in soil microbial functional communities (from 1870 to 2008) from the Park Grass Experiment at Rothamsted Experimental Station, the longest running ecological experiment in the world. Long-term fertilization was found to significantly alter soil functional community structure and led to increasingly convergent succession of soil microbial communities. The importance of stochastic assembly varied greatly in regulating the succession of different microbial guilds. Fertilization had large to medium effects on reducing ecological stochasticity for microbial guilds involved in carbon (C) fixation and degradation, nitrogen (N) fixation and mineralization, and denitrification. This century long-term study elucidated the differing influences of assembly mechanisms on soil microbial functional communities involved in C and N cycling, which has important implications for understanding and predicting the microbial mediated ecological consequences of human-induced environmental changes.",

        "Comment": "Natural abundance delta N-15 values of plant tissue amino acids (AAs) reflect the cycling of N into and within plants, providing an opportunity to better understand environmental and anthropogenic effects on plant metabolism. In this study, the AA delta N-15 values of barley (Hordeum vulgare) and bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) grains and rachis and broad bean (Vicia faba) and pea (Pisum sativum) seeds, grown at the experimental farm stations of Rothamsted, UK and Bad Lauchstadt, Germany, were determined by GC-C-IRMS. It was found that the delta N-15 values of cereal grain and rachis AAs could be largely attributed to metabolic pathways involved in their biosynthesis and catabolism. The relative N-15-enrichment of phenylalanine can be attributed to its involvement in the phenylpropanoid pathway and glutamate has a delta N-15 value which is an average of the other AAs due to its central role in AA-N cycling. The relative M delta N-15 values of broad bean and pea seeds were very different from one another, providing evidence for differences in the metabolic routing of AAs to the developing seeds in these leguminous plants. This study has shown that AA delta N-15 values relate to known AA biosynthetic pathways in plants and thus have the potential to aid understanding of how various external factors, such as source of assimilated N, influence metabolic cycling of N within plants.

        "Comment": "The long-term increasing trend of annual mean temperature is only one aspect of recent climate change. Other changes in climate, seen in within-year weather patterns relevant to crop production, have also occurred since the late-19th Century. Multivariate analysis combining Principal Components Analysis and K-means clustering applied to temporal meteorological datasets (monthly summaries of rainfall, temperature and sunlight duration at Rothamsted Research, UK, between 1892 and 2016) identified ten distinct clusters of years, each with different annual weather patterns. The frequency of occurrence of the years within each cluster altered considerably during this period, with the late 20th and early 21st Century distinctly different to earlier in the 20th Century, providing clear evidence of climate change with regard to the whole weather profile rather than just warming alone. The most-frequently represented cluster of the 21st Century to date had warmer temperatures with more intense rainfall but a dry June, compared to all other clusters. Half of the clusters identified were not represented in the most-recent 25-year period. Analysis of the total biomass yield of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), and grassland amongst the different weather clusters showed that years in clusters typical of the 20th Century climate provided greater off-take than those from the early-21st Century, but this impact was less for the pasture than for the two cereal crops implying herbage production was the more resilient to the changing climate at this site.",

        "Comment": "Chalk in the 0\u20139 in topsoil of Broadbalk has declined from nearly 5% in 1865 to less than 1 % in some plots in 1966, and fastest in plots given ammonium sulphate. Losses were equivalent to 5\u20138 cwt limestone/acre annually. The paper relates these rates to estimated anion losses, especially bicarbonate, from the plots. Af-ammonium acetate dissolved Ca and Mg from chalk particles in the soils. After correcting for this, exchangeable magnesium had increased during the first 50 years but decreased since 1914 in the F.Y.M. plot. In plots given none or 10 lb/acre of magnesium in fertilizer annually, exchangeable magnesium had changed little since 1865. This suggests that equilibrium was soon established between additions and losses of Mg in all except the F.Y.M. plots. Estimates of annual additions and losses of Mg from each plot show that an equilibrium is feasible without large gains from non-exchangeable soil resources. A method of calculating losses of Mg in the drainage using activity ratios and annual calcium losses was developed.",

        "Comment": "Realistic targets for soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations are needed, accounting for differences between soils and land uses. We assess the use of SOC/clay ratio for this purpose by comparing changes over time in (a) the National Soil Inventory of England and Wales, first sampled in 1978\u20131983 and resampled in 1994\u20132003, and (b) two long-term experiments under ley-arable rotations on contrasting soils in the East of England. The results showed that normalising for clay concentration provides a more meaningful separation between land uses than changes in SOC alone. Almost half of arable soils in the NSI had degraded SOC/clay ratios (<?1/13), compared with just 5% of permanent grass and woodland soils. Soils with initially large SOC/clay ratios (??1/8) were prone to greater losses of SOC between the two NSI samplings than those with smaller ratios. The results suggest realistic long-term targets for SOC/clay in arable, ley grass, permanent grass and woodland soils are 1/13, 1/10, and >?1/8, respectively. Given the wide range of soils and land uses across England and Wales in the datasets used to test these targets, they should apply across similar temperate regions globally, and at national to sub-regional scales.",

        "Comment": "We have examined the effect that acid deposition and other sources of acidity have had over the last 110-140 years on soil under woodland (Broadbalk and Geescroft Wildernesses) and grassland (Park Grass) comprising some of the Classical Experiments at Rothamsted Experimental Station. Changes in soil chemistry have been followed by analysing some of the unique archive of stored samples for pH, water-soluble and exchangeable base cations, aluminium, iron and manganese, exchangeable acidity, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and soluble anions. Proton balances and historical data show the importance of acid deposition to acidification and concomitant changes in the chemistry of the soil. The pH of the surface soil of Geescroft Wilderness has fallen from 6.2 to 3.8 since 1883. The decrease in the pH of the unlimed, unfertilized plot on Park Grass was less over a similar period (from pH 5.2 to 4.2), illustrating the significant effect of the woodland canopy on the interception of acidifying pollutants. The effect of increasing acidity on the soil chemistry of Geescroft Wilderness is seen in its decreasing base saturation and CEC, with base cations moving down the soil profile. Clay minerals are being irreversibly weathered, and Mn and Al progressively mobilized, so that today Al occupies 70% of the exchange complex in the surface soil. Even with present reductions in sulphur deposition critical loads for sulphur, nitrogen and acidity are still exceeded. Such semi-natural ecosystems are unsustainable under the current climate of pollution. ",

        "Comment": "The sequestration in soil of organic carbon (SOC) derived from atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) by replacing arable crops with leys, has been measured over 70 years on a sandy loam soil. The experiment was designed initially to test the effect of leys on the yields of arable crops. A 3-year grazed grass with clover  (grass+clover) ley in a 5-year rotation with arable crops increased percentage organic carbon (%OC) in the top 25 cmof the soil from 0.98 to 1.23 in 28 years, but with little further increase during the next 40 years with all-grass leys given fertilizer nitrogen (N). In this second period, OC inputs were balanced by losses, suggesting that about 1.3% OC might be near the equilibrium content for this rotation. Including 3-year lucerne (Medicago sativa) leys had little effect on %OC over 28 years, but after changing to grass+clover leys, %OC increased to 1.24 during the next 40 years. Eight-year leys (all grass with N or grass+clover) in 10-year rotations with arable crops were started in the 1970s, and after three rotations %OC had increased to ca. 1.40 in 2000\u20132009. Over 70 years, %OC declined from 0.98 to 0.94 in an all-arable rotation with mainly cereals and to 0.82 with more root crops. Applications of 38 t ha?1 farmyard manure (FYM) every fifth year increased %OC by 0.13% by the mid-1960s when applications ceased. Soil treated with FYM still contained 0.10% more OC in 2000\u20132009. Changes in the amount of OC have been modelled with RothC-26.3 and estimated inputs of C for selected rotations. Little of the OC input during the 70 years has been retained; most was retained in the grazed ley rotation, but 9 t ha?1 only of a total input of 189 t ha?1. In other rotations more than 98% of the total OC input was lost. Despite large losses of C, annual increases in OC of 4\u2030 are possible on this soil type with the inclusion of grass or grass+clover leys or the application of FYM, but only for a limited period. Such increases in SOC might help to limit increases in atmospheric CO2. ",

        "Comment": "We compared inorganic and organic P fractions to a soil depth of 92 cm in two long-term Classical Experiments at Rothamsted Research in the U.K. The predominant soil-forming factor that differentiated the sites was vegetation type. The Broadbalk plots feature annual wheat and have been in continuous production since 1843, while the Park Grass plots feature perennial grassland vegetation that has been hayed every year since 1856. To evaluate the long-term effects of annual versus perennial vegetation on soil P forms, we carried out Hedley P fractionations and microbial biomass-P fumigation-extraction analyses on soils from fertilized and unfertilized treatments of both experiments. In both P-fertilized and unfertilized soils we found an inverse relationship between pool sizes of actively cycling Po (0.5 M bicarbonate + 0.1 M NaOH fractions) and recalcitrant Pi (hot conc. HCl + final digest fractions) with Po dominant in the perennial hay meadow and recalcitrant Pi dominant in the annual wheat. Microbial biomass-P in the surface horizons of fertilized and unfertilized perennial hay meadow was an order of magnitude greater than in annual wheat. To investigate how P fractions changed through time we conducted Hedley P fractionations on archived soils sampled from Broadbalk wheat in 1893, and Park Grass hay meadow in 1876. Since 1893, unfertilized Broadbalk soils experienced almost no change in P fractions in the surface 23 cm, but substantial depletion in labile and recalcitrant Pi and Po in deeper strata. The Park Grass perennial vegetation showed greater depletion of surface soil fractions over time. When fertilized for over 100 years, almost all P fractions in the surface 23 cm were enriched in both crop types, but below 70 cm, only the active Po pool in Park Grass showed a substantial increase under fertilization. Even when fertilized, low available or occluded Pi fractions in both annual and perennial systems were substantially depleted below 70 cm. Our findings suggest that herbaceous perennials maintain a greater proportion of native or fertilizer-P in relatively available organic forms compared to annual wheat. By reducing the fraction of P held in recalcitrant forms, P fertilizer requirements could be reduced (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Today a difference of 1.2 can be observed in the pH levels of the control and fertilized plots; the pH level of the control plot has decreased about 1.0, that of the fertilized plot about 2.2 as a result of 150 years of acid deposition and fertilization. The changes in the pH levels has caused many changes in the heavy metal content of the top layer of the soil. Using different extraction methods (e.g., ammonium acetate, EDTA, and sequential analysis), the heavy metal content of different fractions have been estimated. In the control plot, the Zn, Cd and Pb content increased. In the fertilized plot, the Pb and Cd contents have also increased because of atmospheric deposition and small amounts of lead in the fertilizer. The available form of Cd and Pb increased in both the control and the fertilized plots. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag 1996.",

        "Comment": "The effects of past applications of farmyard manure (FYM, applied from 1942 to 1967), metal-contaminated sewage sludge (applied from 1942 to 1961) and mineral fertilizer (NPK, applied from 1942 until now) on the microbial biomass and community structure in a sandy loam, arable soil from the Woburn Market Garden Experiment, UK, were investigated in 1998. Concentrations of Cu, Ni and Zn in soils which previously received sewage sludge were less than current European Union (EU) limits, but the soil Cd concentration was more than twice the permitted limit. Organic-C concentration in the FYM-treated soil and contaminated soils was about twice that of NPK-treated soil. The initial microbial biomass-C and estimates of total bacterial numbers by acridine orange direct count were significantly (P < 0.05) greater in the FYM-treated soil compared with the NPK-treated and the most contaminated soils. Total phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) concentration (another measure of biomass) was significantly greater in the FYM-treated soil compared with either the low or high metal-contaminated soils, both of which contained similar PLFA concentrations. In the metal-contaminated soils, in contrast, fluorescent Pseudomonas counts, as a percentage of total plate counts, were at least 1.5 times greater than in the uncontaminated soils. The concentrations of these microbial parameters were significantly (P < 0.05) less in the NPK soil than in all the other treatments. Biomass-C as a percentage of organic-C was also significantly (P < 0.05) greater in the uncontaminated soils compared with the metal-contaminated soils. Biomass specific respiration rates in the metal-contaminated soils were c. 1.5 times those in the FYM-treated soil. In the metal-contaminated soils, the concentration of mono-unsaturated and hydroxy-fatty acids (derived from phospholipids), and lipopolysaccharide hydroxy-fatty acids (all indicative of Gram-negative bacteria) were significantly (P < 0.05) greater than branched fatty acids (indicative of Gram-positive bacteria). Furthermore, Gram-negative counts were 62-68% greater than Gram-positive counts in the metal-contaminated soils. Branched fatty acid concentration was significantly (P < 0.05) greater in the FYM-treated soil than in the metal-contaminated soils. Gram-positive counts were also 63% greater than Gram-negative counts in the FYM-treated soil. We found that effects of the relatively small heavy metal concentration caused measurable decreases in soil microbial biomass-C concentrations, acridine orange direct counts and Gram-positive counts. There were also increases in biomass specific respiration rates, and the microbial community had changed substantially, nearly 40 years after the metal inputs ceased. We conclude that, at the very least, the current EU permitted limits for heavy metals in agricultural soils should not be relaxed.",

        "Comment": "Field data about the effect of soil pH on phosphorus (P) cycling is limited. A promising tool to study P cycling under field conditions is the 18O:16O ratio of phosphate (?18OP). In this study we investigate whether the ?18OP can be used to elucidate the effect\u00a0of soil pH on P cycling in grasslands. Soils and plants were sampled from different fertilisation and lime treatments of the Park Grass long term experiment at Rothamsted Research, UK. The soils were sequentially extracted to isolate different soil P pools, including available P and corresponding ?18OP values were determined. We did not observe changes in plant ?18OP value, but soil P ?18OP values changed, and lower ?18OP values were associated with higher soil pH values. At sites where P was not limiting, available P ?18OP increased by up to 3\u2030 when lime was applied. We show that the ?18OP method is a useful tool to investigate the effect of pH on soil P cycling under field conditions as it highlights that different soil processes must govern P availability as pH shifts. The next challenge is now to identify these underlying processes, enabling better management of soil P at different pH.",

Samples taken between 1856 and 1987 and kept in archive were fractionated for particle size and analysed for changes in mineralogy by X-ray diffraction and changes in total K of the coarser and fine fractions. These were compared with K balances made from records of cropping and fertilizer application. No change in mica due to cropping and K-depletion could be detected. Deep ploughing after 1925 mixed chlorite from the subsoil into the surface soil, but this had weathered by 1987. Potassium balances did not agree with measured changes in total K presumably because of unquantified uptake of K from the subsoil and poorly quantified K leaching.",

        "Comment": "Changes in our understanding of the behaviour of soil, fertiliser and manure phosphorus (P) during the last 150 years are presented. When linked with agronomic data, there is clear evidence that P is not irreversibly fixed in most soils, and that a reserve of plant-available P accumulates from past applications of P fertilisers and organic manures. Data are presented supporting the proposal that soil inorganic P can be considered as existing in four pools, which are related to the strength of bonding of the P to soil components and thus the plant-availability of the P and its extractability by chemical reagents. The stronger the bonding of phosphate ions to soil components the lower the availability of P to plants. P-use efficiency in agriculture is related to soils reaching and being maintained at a critical level of readily plant-available P, and factors affecting the critical level are discussed. When soils are maintained at about the critical level for a particular soil type and cropping system soil P residues are used more effectively. Efficiency can be assessed by the direct, difference and balance methods. The latter, when calculated as the removal to use ratio, shows that P use efficiency can exceed 80-90%. Combined data from controlled experiments in England and derived 'statewide' aggregate information in the United States relating removal to use ratios to changes in plant-available P could best be described by a single, simple function, making a powerful and convincing argument that there is an underlying 'simple rule' for the behaviour of plantavailable inorganic soil P that is related to the four-pool concept discussed in this paper.",

        "Comment": "Long-term experiments are one vital tool for studying the impacts of agricultural management practices on soil properties and crop production; however, they have several limitations that must be recognized. Such experiments are resources for research \u2013 not museum exhibits that can never be altered. For example, in the Broadbalk Wheat Experiment (started 1843), the original large plots have been split so that additional cropping systems can be studied, in particular wheat grown in a crop rotation in addition to the original monoculture. A key finding from all long-term experiments is that soil organic carbon (SOC) content tends to move from one quasi-equilibrium value to another under the influence of changes in management; it does not increase or decrease indefinitely. Compared to unfertilized plots, application of manure caused a large increase in SOC, whereas N fertilizer caused a small increase. Measurements made on the Broadbalk Experiment show that a small change in SOC content can have a disproportionately large impact on a range of soil physical properties. Long-term experiments are valuable for investigating the range of chemical structures within SOC and their distribution between physically separated fractions. Other recent uses include studies on the microbial oxidation of methane and reduction of nitrate in soil, soil biodiversity, and losses of nitrate and phosphate to streams and groundwater.",

        "Comment": "The insoluble, non-hydrolyzable, macromolecular material isolated from a forest soil from Lacadee (south-west France) was examined via a combination of various methods: FTIR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, \"off-line\" pyrolysis and high resolution transmission electron microscopy. Such a resistant material, which accounts for ca. 25% of total humin, was shown to be chiefly composed of melanoidins and black carbon. Two types of black carbon particles were identified by dark field and lattice fringe electron microscopy. Contrary to previous observations, based on solid state C-13 NMR spectroscopy and Curie point Py/GC/MS, highly aliphatic moieties only afford a minor contribution to the refractory material of the Lacadee soil. Additional studies, using mixtures of model compounds, were carried out to examine the origin of this conspicuous overestimation of the level of aliphaticity in such heterogeneous material when the latter two methods are used.

        "Comment": "In this work we analyzed the sterol content of agricultural soils. Three eukaryotic sterols, cholesterol, beta-sitosterol, and ergosterol were chosen as representative of the, animal, plant, and fungal kingdoms, while coprostanol was validated as a marker of human fecal matter contamination. Three soils subjected to different treatments (sewage sludge application, irrigation by, saline waters, and contamination by industrial and municipal wastes) were sampled and their sterol content was measured and compared with adjacent untreated soils. The effects of time, location, and treatment were evaluated by means of a number of statistical techniques. beta-Sitosterol concentration varied from 0.9 to 30 mg kg(-1). Lesser values were measured in Cremona (2.1 mg kg(-1)) than in Bari (4.0 mg kg(-1)) and Naples (10.9 mg kg(-1)) soils. No significant effects were detected for cholesterol and ergosterol. Coprostanol was present after sewage sludge disposal and contamination by industrial,and municipal-wastes, while it was absent in the soil treated with saline water and in the adjacent untreated soil. Coprostanol concentration did not-vary much within site and time sampling with a value of 0.2 mg kg(-1). We confirmed coprostanol as a useful persistent marker of human fecal matter contamination. Multivariate analysis high, lighted a clear distinction between the eukaryotic sterols and coprostanol. In addition, a different behavior between ergosterol and cholesterol on one side and P-sitosterol on the other was detected. This preliminary work suggests that sterols deserve a deeper study of their use as indicators in agricultural soils.",

The niche variation hypothesis predicts that populations with few interspecific competitors and hence broader niches are expected to contain greater genetic diversity. The coexistence hypothesis predicts that genetic diversity within species favours coexistence among species and therefore species and genetic diversity should be positively correlated. Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) markers were used to measure the genetic diversity of populations of Anthoxanthum odoratum growing in 10 plots of differing species richness that lie along resource and soil pH gradients. Genetic diversity in A. odoratum was positively correlated with the number of resources added to a plot, but not correlated with species richness. However, separate analyses have shown a negative correlation between resource addition and species richness at Park Grass and elsewhere, so genetic and species diversity appear to respond in opposite directions.",

        "Comment": "1 A 60-year time-series of species recorded in visual surveys of the plant communities of the Park Grass Experiment is analysed to detect changes through time in the frequency of species on seven plots with acidified soil and on 35 non- acidified plots. 2 Of 14 species recor;ded on the acidified plots, eight decreased with time, one (Agrostis capillaris) increased, four showed no trend and one (Chamerion angustifolium) showed an outbreak with a peak in 1946. Of the 43 species recorded on the nonacidified plots, six increased, five decreased, 10 showed outbreaks and 22 showed no trend. 3 We used discriminant analysis to try to identify combinations of seven life-history and two habitat variables that would correctly classify species according to how their frequency changed on the non-acidified plots. Habitat variables (mean pH and mean hay yield of plots) were poor discriminators, but some life history variables (notably ruderalness, mating system and flowering time) were more successful. 4 Species which increased were more outcrossing whereas outbreak species were more selfing than the average for all species, both were more ruderal than average. We speculate that the ruderal species were all well equipped to spread across plots, but that only outcrossing species possessed sufficient genetic variation to be able to sustain a broad distribution in the heterogeneous environment represented by the PGE. 5 In view of the otherwise stable nature of the Park Grass communities we suggest that the existence of outbreaks in a significant number of species calls for a reevaluation of the concept of the stable plant community.",

        "Comment": "The aims of this study were: (1) to compare different microbial methods of detecting the effects of heavy metals on the functioning of the soil ecosystem: and (2) to evaluate the effect of incubation on microbial biomass and microbial activity in soils that were not pre-incubated after sampling in order to determine their suitability for measuring the effects of heavy metals on the soil microbial ecosystem. The microbial biomass methods included: biomass C, N and ninhydrin-N by fumigation-extraction (FE); substrate-induced respiration (SIR); soil ATP content and microbial activity as evolved CO2-C and arginine ammonification. All were tested in soils from the Woburn Market Garden Experiment. Due to past sludge application the soils contained, Zn, Cu or Ni at around current European Union upper limits and Cd at up to three times the limit. The amount of microbial biomass in metal-contaminated soils was about half of that found in soils from the experiment that received uncontaminated organic manure or inorganic fertilizer. The amount of biomass measured by FE and soil ATP content in incubated soils showed little change over 20 days incubation. However, SIR measurements were statistically affected over the first few days of incubation. The rates of arginine ammonification were higher in this order: farmyard manure (FYM) > inorganic fertilizer > sewage-sludge throughout the incubation. However, the evolved CO2-C rates were not significantly different among the treatments. Discriminant analysis confirmed smaller amounts of biomass in the metal-contaminated soils than in the other treatments. Linked properties, such as relationships between biomass and soil organic matter, or biomass-specific respiration rates, may provide \"internal control\" which may help overcome problems of establishing suitable control, or comparative measurements, when moving from experimental to natural environments.

        "Comment": "Tortuosity is a parameter characterising the complexity of pore geometry in porous media for fluids and solutes to move through. It is loosely defined and has been calculated by different methods based on either the pore geometry or a special transport process. While it has been known that tortuosities calculated from different methods vary, it remains obscure if there is a one-to-one relationship between them, especially for soils which are not randomly structured but self-organised by a myriad of interactive biotic and abiotic processes. We studied this based on X-ray images of 30 soil aggregates taken from fields which have been under different land managements for more than 70\u00a0years and thus have contrasting structures. The tortuosity of every soil sample was calculated using three methods: viscous fluid flow, solute diffusion, and geometric structure of the pores, with the former two calculated from pore-scale simulations. The results showed that although the tortuosities calculated by all methods are correlated, their correlation is weak and there is no one-to-one relationship between them. On average, the tortuosity calculated from fluid flow is the highest and the geometrical tortuosity is the least, with that calculated from solute diffusion in between. The tortuosity calculated from all three methods decreases as porosity increases, but the coefficient of determination is low. We also found that the bulk diffusion coefficient cannot be predicted using geometrical tortuosity and porosity of the soils from the formulae suggested in the literature. These findings reveal that tortuosity is a process-dependent parameter rather than an intrinsic soil property, and that tortuosity calculated from different methods cannot be used interchangeably to estimate soil transport parameters.",

        "Comment": "Two UK grassland soils, one from Rothamsted (24% clay) and the other from Woburn (8% clay) were incubated at 25 degrees C, unamended or amended with ryegrass followed by fumigation 20 d later followed by a further 20 d incubation. Other portions of the Rothamsted grassland soil were treated separately with a fungicide (Captan), a bacteriocide (Bronopol), or a herbicide (Dinoseb). The substrate-induced respiration (SIR) method coupled with use of antibiotics (selective inhibition) and biovolume measurements by direct microscopy were used to comparatively measure total microbial biomass and the proportions of fungal and bacterial biomass in these two treated soils. Both methods gave similar estimates of total microbial biomass and the proportions of bacteria and fungi in the two soils. The different treatments did not significantly change the proportions of bacteria and fungi in the soil microbial biomass. It was concluded that both SIR and biovolume measurements are equally valid in measuring total biomass as are selective inhibition and biovolume measurements in measuring the proportions of fungi and bacteria in soils which are either unamended or undergoing rapid changes in metabolism due to substrate amendment, fumigation or biocidal treatments.

        "Comment": "Although the Park Grass Experiment is an important international reference soil for temperate grasslands, it still lacks the direct extraction of its metaproteome. The identification of these proteins can be crucial to our understanding of soil ecology and major biogeochemical processes. However, the extraction of protein from soil is a technically fraught process due to difficulties with co-extraction of humic material and lack of compatible databases to identify proteins. To address these issues, we combined two protein extraction techniques on Park Grass experiment soil, one based on humic acid removal, namely a modified freeze-dry, heat/thaw/phenol/chloroform (HTPC) method and another which co-extracts humic material, namely an established surfactant method. A broad range of proteins were identified by matching the mass spectra of extracted soil proteins against a tailored Park Grass proteome database. These were mainly in the categories of \u201cprotein metabolism\u201d, \u201cmembrane transport\u201d, \u201ccarbohydrate metabolism\u201d, \u201crespiration\u201d \u201cribosomal and nitrogen cycle\u201d proteins, enabling reconstitution of specific processes in grassland soil. Protein annotation using NCBI and EBI databases inferred that the Park Grass soil is dominated by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria and Firmicutes at phylum level and Bradyrhizobium, Rhizobium, Acidobacteria, Streptomyces and Pseudolabrys at genus level. Further functional enrichment analysis enabled us to connect protein identities to regulatory and signalling networks of key biogeochemical cycles, notably the nitrogen cycle. The newly identified Park Grass metaproteome thus provides a baseline on which future targeted studies of important soil processes and their control can be built.",

Therefore, any small change in the amount of soil organic C (SOC) may affect carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in the atmosphere. Dynamic models of SOC help reveal the interaction among soil carbon systems, climate and land  management, and they are also frequently used to help assess SOC dynamics. Those models often use allometric functions to calculate soil C inputs in which the amount of C in both above and below ground crop residues are assumed to be proportional to crop harvest yield. Here we argue that simulating changes in SOC stocks based on C input that are proportional to crop yield is not supported by data from long-term experiments with measured SOC changes. Rather, there is evidence that root C inputs are largely independent of crop yield, but crop specific. We discuss implications of applying fixed belowground C input regardless of crop yield on agricultural greenhouse gas mitigation and accounting.",

        "Comment": "The spatial genetic structure of plant populations is determined by a combination of gene flow, genetic drift, and natural selection. Gene flow in most plants can result from either seed or pollen dispersal, but detailed investigations of pollen and seed flow among populations that have diverged following local adaptation are lacking. In this study, we compared pollen and seed flow among 10 populations of sweet vernal grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum) on the Park Grass Experiment. Overall, estimates of genetic differentiation that were based on chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) and, which therefore resulted primarily from seed flow, were lower (average F(ST) = 0.058) than previously published estimates that were based on nuclear DNA (average F(ST) = 0.095). Unlike nuclear DNA, cpDNA showed no pattern of isolation by adaptation; cpDNA differentiation was, however, inversely correlated with the number of additions (nutrients and lime) that each plot had received. We suggest that natural selection is restricting pollen flow among plots, whereas nutrient additions are increasing seed flow and genetic diversity by facilitating the successful germination and growth of immigrant seeds. This study highlights the importance of considering all potential gene flow mechanisms when investigating determinants of spatial genetic structure, and cautions against the widespread assumption that pollen flow is more important than seed flow for population connectivity in wind-pollinated species.",

        "Comment": "The influence of pH on the relative importance of the two principal decomposer groups in soil, fungi and bacteria, was investigated along a continuous soil pH gradient at Hoosfield acid strip at Rothamsted Research in the United Kingdom. This experimental location provides a uniform pH gradient, ranging from pH 8.3 to 4.0, within 180 m in a silty loam soil on which barley has been continuously grown for more than 100 years. We estimated the importance of fungi and bacteria directly by measuring acetate incorporation into ergosterol to measure fungal growth and leucine and thymidine incorporation to measure bacterial growth. The growth-based measurements revealed a fivefold decrease in bacterial growth and a fivefold increase in fungal growth with lower pH. This resulted in an approximately 30-fold increase in fungal importance, as indicated by the fungal growth/bacterial growth ratio, from pH 8.3 to pH 4.5. In contrast, corresponding effects on biomass markers for fungi (ergosterol and phospholipid fatty acid [PLFA] 18:2 omega 6,9) and bacteria (bacterial PLFAs) showed only a two- to three-fold difference in fungal importance in the same pH interval. The shift in fungal and bacterial importance along the pH gradient decreased the total carbon mineralization, measured as basal respiration, by only about one-third, possibly suggesting functional redundancy. Below pH 4.5 there was universal inhibition of all microbial variables, probably derived from increased inhibitory effects due to release of free aluminum or decreasing plant productivity. To investigate decomposer group importance, growth measurements provided significantly increased sensitivity compared with biomass-based measurements.",

        "Comment": "Fatty acids as major compounds of soil lipids may affect many soil properties, but the input and turnover rates in soil are largely unknown. The objective of this study was to identify and quantify fatty acids in soils as a result of input from primary sources such as plant residues, farmyard manure and soil organisms, and to evaluate the corresponding turnover- and stabilization processes. The concentrations of n-C-10:0 to n-C-34:0 fatty acids were determined in the Ap horizon of a Phaeozem with long-term cropping of rye and maize and the treatments 'Unfertilized' ('U') and fertilized with 'Farmyard manure' ('FYM'). The most important primary sources of fatty acids such as rye and maize stubble and roots, soil micro- and mesofauna, and the applied FYM were also investigated. The quantification of fatty acids by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) showed that long-term FYM application led to larger concentrations of n-alkyl fatty acids in the plots grown with rye ('U': 48.1 mu g g(-1), 'FYM': 57.7 mu g g(-1), **P <= 0.01, n = 3) and maize ('U': 17.0 mu g g(-1), 'FYM': 23.4 mu g g(-1), ***P <= 0.001, n=3). The observed bimodal fatty acid distribution in soils from n-C-10:0 to n-C-21:0 and from n-C-21:0 to n-C-34:0 with a predominance at n-C-16:0 and at n-C-28:0 was apparently due to input from crop residues, soil organisms and FYM. The short-chain lengths may have originated from the investigated primary sources. The major contributors to the long-chain lengths, with a maximum at n-C-28:0, were rye stubble and FYM. A change in mono-culture from rye to maize, 38 years prior to sampling, led to a decrease in fatty acid concentrations by factors of about 2.8 ('U') and 2.5 ('FYM'). Therefore, rye-derived fatty acids and soil tillage had a larger impact on fatty acid pools than the input of primary organic matter. The changes in fatty acid distributions and pools under the consideration of the quantified input of primary organic matter led to the conclusion that the short-chained fatty acids were more rapidly decomposed than the long-chains.

        "Comment": "Assessments of changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks depend heavily on reliable values of SOC content obtained by automated high-temperature C analysers. However, historical as well as current research often relies on indirect SOC estimates such as loss-on-ignition (LOI). In this study, we revisit the conversion of LOI to SOC using soil from two long-term agricultural field experiments and one arable field with different contents of SOC, clay and particles <20??m (Fines20). Clay-, silt- and sand-sized fractions were isolated from the arable soil. Samples were analysed for texture, LOI (500\u00b0C for 4?hours) and SOC by dry combustion. For a topsoil with 2?g?C and 30?g clay 100?g?1 soil, converting LOI to SOC by the conventional factor 0.58 overestimated the SOC stock by 45?Mg?C?ha?1. The error increased with increasing contents of clay and Fines20. Converting LOI to SOC by a regression model underestimated the SOC stock by 5?Mg?C?ha?1 at small clay and Fines20 contents and overestimated the SOC stock by 8?Mg?C?ha?1 at large contents. This was due to losses of structural water from clay minerals. The best model to convert LOI to SOC incorporated clay content. Evaluating this model against an independent dataset gave a root mean square error and mean error of 0.295 and 0.125?g?C?100?g?1, respectively. To avoid misleading accounts of SOC stocks in agricultural soils, we recommend re-analysis of archived soil samples for SOC using high-temperature dry combustion methods. Where archived samples are not available, accounting for clay content improves conversion of LOI to SOC considerably. The use of the conventional conversion factor 0.58 is antiquated and provides misleading estimates of SOC stocks. Highlights Assessment of SOC contents is often based on less accurate methods such as LOI. Reliable accounts of changes in SOC stocks remain high on the agenda (4\u2030 initiative). Conversion of LOI to SOC is considerably improved by accounting for clay content. Converting LOI to SOC by the conventional factor 0.58 leads to grossly overestimated SOC stocks.",

        "Comment": "Increasing demands for productivity together with environmental concerns about fertilizer use dictate that the future sustainability of agricultural systems will depend on improving fertilizer use efficiency. Characterization of the biological processes responsible for efficient fertilizer use will provide tools for crop improvement under reduced inputs. Transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches were used to study the impact of nitrogen (N) and sulphur (S) deficiency on N and S remobilization from senescing canopy tissues during grain filling in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum). Canopy tissue N was remobilized effectively to the grain after anthesis. S was less readily remobilized. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolite profiling revealed significant effects of suboptimal N or S supply in leaves but not in developing grain. Analysis of amino acid pools in the grain and leaves revealed a strategy whereby amino acid biosynthesis switches to the production of glutamine during grain filling. Glutamine accumulated in the first 7 d of grain development, prior to conversion to other amino acids and protein in the subsequent 21 d. Transcriptome analysis indicated that a down-regulation of the terminal steps in many amino acid biosynthetic pathways occurs to control pools of amino acids during leaf senescence. Grain N and S contents increased in parallel after anthesis and were not significantly affected by S deficiency, despite a suboptimal N:S ratio at final harvest. N deficiency resulted in much slower accumulation of grain N and S and lower final concentrations, indicating that vegetative tissue N has a greater control of the timing and extent of nutrient remobilization than S.",

        "Comment": "The link between carbon turnover model pools and measurable carbon fractions is of key interest for initial parameterisation and subsequent validation of dynamic soil carbon models. In this study we performed the established particle-size fractionation of soils from 54 intensively monitored sites in Germany and from archived samples from 5 other long-term experiments in Germany and the United Kingdom. The Rothamsted carbon (RothC) model was then used to compare the measured soil C fractionation from the 54 intensively monitored sites against modelled pools using spin-up equilibrium runs whilst dynamic (non-equilibrium) model runs were performed when comparing data from the long-term experiments. We detected good agreement between measured soil C fractions and modelled pools, indicated by correlation coefficients of 0.73 and 0.81 for the resistant plant material pool (RPM) and 0.91 and 0.94 for the humus pool (HUM) for the intensively monitored and the long-term sites, respectively. Slightly larger errors were detected for the intensively monitored sites together with a bias in the relationship between the RPM pool and particulate organic matter fraction. This bias detected for the intensively monitored sites indicated that the equilibrium assumption for arable agricultural sites, even though under crop cover for at least 50 years, might not be entirely valid. From the relative mean absolute error of 11% for the HUM pool and 26% for the RPM pool of the combined data set we conform that the measured fractions can be used to estimate the RothC model pools in arable soils. Given the magnitude of these errors, however, we rather suggest to apply the fractionation approach instead of using an equilibrium assumption for the RothC initialisation of arable sites.",

        "Comment": "The COSMOS-UK observation network has been providing field-scale soil moisture and hydrometeorological measurements across the UK since 2013. At the time of publication a total of 51 COSMOS-UK sites have been established, each delivering high-temporal resolution data in near-real time. Each site utilizes a cosmic-ray neutron sensor, which counts epithermal neutrons at the land surface. These measurements are used to derive field-scale near-surface soil water content, which can provide unique insight for science, industry, and agriculture by filling a scale gap between localized point soil moisture and large-scale satellite soil moisture datasets. Additional soil physics and meteorological measurements are made by the COSMOS-UK network including precipitation, air temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, soil heat flux, wind speed and direction, and components of incoming and outgoing radiation. These near-real-time observational data can be used to improve the performance of hydrological models, validate remote sensing products, improve hydro-meteorological forecasting, and underpin applications across a range of other scientific fields. The most recent version of the COSMOS-UK dataset is publically available at https://doi.org/10.5285/b5c190e4-e35d-40ea-8fbe-598da03a1185 (Stanley et al., 2021). ",

        "Comment": "Crop yields increased dramatically in the 20th century as recorded on Broadbalk or in world averages. The vast majority of that increase has occurred since the last world war and has been powered by changes in the genetic potential of the crop and in the way in which it has been managed. Nevertheless, the challenge to feed a world population that is likely to rise to 8 billion is formidable, particularly since recent analyses suggest that the rate of increase in yields of several crops may have dropped over the last decade. What are the opportunities to meet this challenge and to continue to improve the yields of our crops? Improvements in agronomy are likely to be more concerned with efficiency and elegance rather than in major breakthroughs. More sophisticated crop protection chemicals designed on the basis of vastly increased screening potentials and (at last?) possibilities of rational design will be supplemented by a battery of decision support systems to aid management choices which can be precisely implemented. Genetic improvement is the area in which to look for the major breakthroughs. The broad potential of recombinant DNA technology will provide the possibility of both molecular analyses of crop productivity and ways in which it may be possible to improve that productivity. The goal of analysis may be approached in three ways: starting at the beginning by generating complete sequences of the plant genome; starting at the end by genetic analysis of phenotypes using genetic marker technology; or, starting in the middle, by metabolic analysis. Improvements may be obtained by re-asserting what has been achieved through enhanced breeding technologies, by randomly induced change, and by generation of totally new possibilities through biochemical engineering. Examples of all approaches will be given. The onset of genomics will provide massive amounts of information, but the success will depend on using that to improve crop phenotypes. The ability to meet the challenges of the 21st century will depend on the ability to close that 'phenotype gap'.",

Assessment of future global phosphorus (P) fertilizer demand in interaction with nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) fertilizers under differentlevels of food demand requires a model-based approach. In this paper we tested use of the QUEFTS model(Quantitative evaluation of Fertility of Tropical Soils) for assessing crop yields in response to N, P and Kapplication in different environments. QUEFTS was initially developed to simulate interactions betweenN, P and K for tropical soils under maize crop. We performed an extensive model analysis of crop yieldsin relation to soil and fertilizer nutrients for six field data sets with maize, rice, and wheat crops grownin tropical and temperate regions. The model equations had to be adapted to broaden the model appli-cability beyond the original boundary conditions of pH, rain-fed cropping systems, optimum harvestindex and temperature. Recalibration and modification resulted in a good agreement between modelpredicted and observed yields. Our results indicate that the adjustments increased the applicability ofthe model. However, for application in global studies QUEFTS is data demanding and, also, further testing(and probably improvement) is needed, since various processes (e.g. inputs of other nutrients than N, Pand K, sub-soil properties and water supply) are ignored in the model, but may differ dramatically acrossthe globe.",

        "Comment": "Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a significant component of the global carbon (C) cycle. Changes in SOCstorage affect atmospheric CO2concentrations on decadal to centennial timescales. The C-TOOL modelwas developed to simulate farm- and regional-scale effects of management on medium- to long-term SOCstorage in the profile of well-drained agricultural mineral soils. C-TOOL uses three SOC pools for both thetopsoil (0\u201325 cm) and the subsoil (25\u2013100 cm), and applies temperature-dependent first order kineticsto regulate C turnover. C-TOOL also enables the simulation of14C turnover. The simple model structurefacilitates calibration and requires few inputs (mean monthly air temperature, soil clay content, soil C/Nratio and C in organic inputs). The model was parameterised using data from 19 treatments drawn fromseven long-term field experiments in the United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark. It was found that theinitial SOC content had to be optimised for each experiment, but also that one set of values for othermodel parameters could be applied at all sites. With this set of parameters, C-TOOL can be applied morewidely to evaluate effects of management options on SOC storage in temperate agricultural soils. C-TOOLsimulates observed losses of SOC in soils under intensive agricultural use and the gain in SOC derivedfrom large inputs of animal manure and inclusion of perennial grassland. The model simulates changesin SOC for the entire profile, but lack of data on subsoil SOC storage hampers a proper model evaluation.Experimental verification of management effects on subsoil C storage, subsoil C inputs from roots, andvertical transport of C in the soil profile remains prioritised research areas.",

        "Comment": "David Jenkinson was one of the most influential soil scientists of his generation, bringing new insights into the transformations of organic matter and nitrogen in soil. He spent the majority of his career at Rothamsted Research, Harpenden, UK. His studies were influential regarding the role of soil carbon stocks in the context of climate change and the role of nitrogen fertilizer in delivering adequate supplies of food for a growing world population. His research encompassed both fundamental studies on soil processes and immensely practical applications of this knowledge, often utilizing the Rothamsted long-term experiments that have run for over 170 years. He is particularly well known for his development of a method for determining the quantity of organic carbon held in the cells of living micro-organisms in soil, termed the \u2018soil microbial biomass\u2019. This breakthrough opened the way for a new wave of soil biological research. David developed one of the earliest computer models for the turnover of organic carbon in soil, known as the Rothamsted Carbon Model, RothC. This model, conceptually very simple, has proved highly successful in simulating and predicting changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) content under different management practices worldwide, being used by over 2600 people in 115 countries. His research using the stable isotope of nitrogen, 15N, in large-scale field experiments drew attention to the factors leading to inefficiencies in the use of nitrogen fertilizer but also demonstrated that it is possible to achieve high efficiency if good agricultural management practices are followed. It also demonstrated, more clearly than previously, the great importance of soil organic matter as a source of nitrogen for crops and the role of the soil microbial biomass both in immobilizing a proportion of applied fertilizer nitrogen and also in causing confusion in the  interpretation of such experiments. By calculating nitrogen budgets for the Rothamsted long-term experiments he quantified the deposition of nitrogen compounds from atmosphere to land, laying foundations for later studies concerning the ecological and agricultural impacts of this significant input of nitrogen.",

        "Comment": "Studies of adaptation in the wild grass <i>Anthoxanthum odoratum</i> at the Park Grass Experiment (PGE) provided one of the earliest examples of rapid evolution in plants. <i>Anthoxanthum</i> has become locally adapted to differences in soil Al toxicity, which have developed there due to soil acidification from long-term experimental fertilizer treatments. In this study, we used transcriptome sequencing to identify Al stress responsive genes in <i>Anthoxanthum</i> and identify candidates among them for further molecular study of rapid Al tolerance evolution at the PGE. We examined the Al content of <i>Anthoxanthum</i> tissues and conducted RNA-sequencing of root tips, the primary site of Al induced damage. We found that despite its high tolerance <i>Anthoxanthum</i> is not an Al accumulating species. Genes similar to those involved in organic acid exudation (TaALMT1, ZmMATE), cell wall modification (OsSTAR1), and internal Al detoxification (OsNRAT1) in cultivated grasses were responsive to Al exposure. Expression of a large suite of novel loci was also triggered by early exposure to Al stress in roots. Three-hundred forty five transcripts were significantly more up- or down-regulated in tolerant vs. sensitive <i>Anthoxanthum</i> genotypes, providing important targets for future study of rapid evolution at the PGE.",

        "Comment": "Wheat is one of the world\u2019s most important crops, but its production relies heavily on agrochemical inputs which can be harmful to the environment when used excessively. It is well known that a multitude of microbes interact with eukaryotic organisms, including plants, and the sum of microbes and their functions associated with a given host is termed the microbiome. Plant-microbe interactions can be beneficial, neutral or harmful to the host plant. Over the last decade, with the development of next generation DNA sequencing technology, our understanding of the plant microbiome structure has dramatically increased. Considering that defining the wheat microbiome is key to leverage crop production in a sustainable way, here we describe how different factors drive microbiome assembly in wheat, including crop management, edaphic-environmental conditions and host selection. In addition, we highlight the benefits to take a multidisciplinary approach to define and explore the wheat core microbiome to generate solutions based on microbial (synthetic) communities or single inoculants. Advances in plant microbiome research will facilitate the development of microbial strategies to guarantee a sustainable intensification of crop production.",

        "Comment": "The soil water release characteristic is controlled by the soil pores and so alteration of the pore system will have an effect. We sought to examine the effects of various pore deformations in a range of arable and grassland soils from the UK. Sieved topsoil materials were compressed to 50 or 200 kPa, or remolded to simulate shear deformation at the plastic limit. They were then subjected to matric potentials from 0 to -1500 kPa using conventional tension and pressure plate apparatus. Volume changes were monitored to assess shrinkage. Further samples in the compressed state were subjected to x-ray computed tomography scanning to nondestructively characterize the soil pore system. Increasing the compression from 50 to 200 kPa mainly affected the >30-?m pores, changing a dual porous system of inter- and intraaggregate pores to one mainly dominated by intraaggregate pores, as confirmed by gravimetric water release characteristic data and the scans. Shear-deformed soils retained more water than the compressed soil and shrank more, such that they remained tension saturated at low (negative) matric potentials. We developed a function to predict the soil saturation state as a function of matric potential and porosity. This explained 28 to 63% of the variance, irrespective of the initial structural state, but up to 94% of the variation when one of the fitted parameters was allowed to vary for the different initial states. This was sufficiently systematic to suggest that a general model of the effects of soil deformation and shrinkage on the water release characteristic may be possible.",

        "Comment": "The analyses of stable isotope ratios of carbon (delta(13)C) and nitrogen (delta(15)N) of soil organic matter (SOM) is an increasingly used tool to estimate soil carbon turnover, to assess degree of soil development, and to study historical C3/C4 vegetation changes. However, the exact processes that control C-13- and N-15-enrichment of SOM within a soil profile are still not clearly identified. To better understand the isotopic processes associated with decomposition: of SOM, we studied two Vertisol profiles and one Oxisol profile from southern Queensland by radibgenic (C-14), stable isotopic (delta(13)C, delta(15)N), and spectroscopic (C-13-NMR and FTIR) methods. The findings of this study demonstrate that fundamental differences exist in delta(13)C and delta(15)N fractionation dynamics in different soil types and that isotopic fractionation is highly influenced by soil chemistry, mineralogy, and type of organic matter input. Stable isotopic analyses of the Oxisol show the typically observed increase in delta(13)C and delta(15)N in the subsurface horizon whereas the Vertisols show consistently decreasing values with depth. The high degree of C-13-enrichment in the Oxisol compared with the Vertisols cannot be simply explained with increased fractionation due to soil age, as the C-14 age of the Vertisols is greater and increases more rapidly with depth, compared with that of the Oxisol. Data from C-13-NMR, XRF and IR data together with data on pH and clay content reveal a more complex picture of isotopic fractionation in soils. The Oxisol is dominated by O-alkyl carbon and aromatic material whereas the Vertisols contain higher amounts of alkyl carbon. Smectite and kaolinite are the dominant clay minerals in the Vertisols while the Oxisol is dominated by gibbsite, kaolinite, and Fe and Al-oxides. We suggest that the C-13- and N-15-depletion in the Vertisols is associated with low pH, which inhibits nitrification and promotes stabilization of C-13-depleted alkyl material by smectitic clays. The C-13-enrichment in the Oxisol correlates with a high abundance of relatively C-13-enriched O-alkylcarbon, which is a mix of primary materials (plant carbohydrates) as well as secondary (microbially synthesized) carbon. The abundance of relatively labile O-alkyl carbon even at depth is likely due to physico-chemical protection through complexation with Fe- and Al-oxides. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "Comment": "Soil organic carbon can be labelled at natural abundance by the cultivation of C-4 plants, e.g, maize, on soils which have been previously cropped with isotopically distinct C-3 plants, e.g. wheat. Particle-size fractions from soils cultivated for 23 years either with maize or wheat have been analysed for C and N contents, and for delta C-13 values of bulk C and of plant-derived n-alkanes (C-29, C-31) The amount of maize-derived organic components has been calculated by isotope balance. After 23 years of maize cropping, delta C-13 values of n-alkanes from the same soil sample increase with particle size. The results have two implications. First, the input of leaf wax n-alkanes into the soil is occurring preferentially via large particles. Second, in a same soil sample, the C-31 n-alkane from the 200-2000 mum particle-size fraction is younger than the C-31 n-alkane from the 50-200 and 0-50 mum fractions. In this respect,C-13 analysis represents a method of relative dating of individual compounds. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "Comment": "Denitrification in subsoils may be a natural process able to decrease NO3 contamination of groundwater. We studied this process and how it was affected by long-term fertilization practices. We collected soil to a depth of 2 m from four treatments in the Broadbalk Continuous Wheat Experiment, One treatment (FYM) had received manure applications annually since 1843, while the other treatments were NO (0 kg N ha(-1) since 1843), N4 (196 kg N ha(-1) since 1968) and N6 (288 kg N ha(-1) since 1984). Using the acetylene inhibition method, we measured N2O production from anaerobic slurries of either unamended or amended (plus C and NO3) samples of surface soil and three subsoil depth layers. These results will not equate to actual field denitrification rates, but the amended treatments (i.e, plus C and NO3) will indicate the relative denitrification capacities of the soils, Thr unamended treatment will more accurately indicate the relative field denitrification rates. In the surface soils, denitrification Fates were approximately proportional to total organic C (TOC) and they increased in the following order. N0, N4, N6, FYM. In the subsoil, denitrification declined with depth, and at 1.2 m was only a small fraction of that at the surface. There was no relationship between surface soil fertilization practices and either subsoil denitrification capacity, TOC, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) or total N. Indeed subsoil (60-200 cm) denitrification capacity was not significantly different between treatments. Denitrification capacity in unamended subsoils was not related to DOG. However, there was a significant relationship (R-2 = 0.41) between TOC and denitrification rate. When amended soils were conditioned aerobically for 5 days, N2O production increased, indicating the presence of a small community of denitrifiers which multiplied when given a C source. We conclude that subsoil denitrification has the potential to decrease NO3 concentrations of percolating waters but is in reality limited by biologically available C. On our Broadbalk site, surface soil management had no effect upon the amount of 'available' C in the subsoil. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The extent to which such strategies succeed in achieving mitigation, adaptation and productivity goals is referred to as climate-smartness. The co-evolution of yield and Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) over the years presents a proxy for the trade-off between productivity, soil fertility and carbon sequestration. Yield and SOC are widely monitored, analysed and used to inform CSA planning. Yet their analysis is often conducted separately and for a small number of years, which neglects long-term soil fertility dynamics and their impact on crops. Given the absence of integrated climate-smartness metrics to capture the trade-offs and synergies between SOC and yield, we present a soil-based Climate-Smartness Index (SCSI). The SCSI is computed using normalized indicators of trend and variability of annual changes on yield and SOC data. The SCSI was calculated for a set of published experiments that compared Conservation Agriculture (CA) practices with conventional management. The CA treatments scored higher SCSI during the first 5\u00a0years of evaluation as compared to conventional management. Analysis of the temporal dynamics of climate-smartness indicated that minimum SCSI values typically occurred before 5\u00a0years after the start of the experiment, indicating potential trade-offs between SOC and yield. Conversely, SCSI values peaked between 5 and 10\u00a0years. After 20\u00a0years, the SCSI tended towards zero, as substantial changes in either SOC or yield are no longer evidenced. The SCSI can be calculated for annual crops under any soil management and at different time periods, providing a consistent metric for climate-smartness across both practices and time.",

        "Comment": "AbstractGround level enhancements (GLEs) are space weather events that pose a potential hazard to the aviation environment through single event effects (SEE) in avionics and increased dose to passengers and crew. The existing ground level neutron monitoring network provides continuous and well-characterised measurements of the radiation environment. However, there are only a few dozen active stations worldwide, and there hasn\u2019t been a UK-based station for several decades. Much smaller neutron detectors are increasingly deployed throughout the world with the purpose of using secondary neutrons from cosmic rays to monitor local soil moisture conditions (COSMOS). Space weather signals from ground level enhancements (GLEs) and Forbush decreases have been identified in COSMOS data. Monte Carlo simulations of atmospheric radiation propagation show that a single COSMOS detector is sufficient to detect the signal of a medium-strength (10-100% increase above background) ground level enhancement (GLE) at high statistical significance, including at fine temporal resolution. Use of fine temporal resolution would also provide a capability to detect Terrestrial Gamma Ray Flashes (via secondary neutrons) which are produced by certain lightning discharges and which can provide a hazard to aircraft, particularly in tropical regions. We also show how the COSMOS-UK detector network could be used to provide warnings at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) \u201cModerate\u201d and \u201cSevere\u201d dose rate thresholds at aviation altitudes, and how multiple-detector hubs situated at strategic UK locations could detect a small GLE at high statistical significance and infer crucial information on the nature of the primary spectrum.",

        "Comment": "The Park Grass Experiment at Rothamsted in southeast England was started in 1856, making it the longest-running experiment in plant ecology anywhere in the world. Experimental inputs include a range of fertilizers (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and organic manures) applied annually, with lime applied occasionally, and these have led to an increase in biomass and, where nitrogen was applied in the form of ammonium sulfate, to substantial decreases in soil pH. The number of species per plot varies from three to 44 per 200 m(2), affording a unique opportunity to study the determinants of plant species richness and to estimate the effect sizes attributable to different factors. The response of species richness to biomass depends on the amount and type of nitrogen applied; richness declined monotonically with increasing biomass on plots receiving no nitrogen or receiving nitrogen in the form of sodium nitrate, but there was no relationship between species richness and biomass on plots acidified by ammonium sulfate application. The response to lime also depended on the type of nitrogen applied; there was no relationship between lime treatment and species richness, except in plots receiving nitrogen in the form of ammonium sulfate, where species richness increased sharply with increasing soil pH. The addition of phosphorus reduced species richness, and application of potassium along with phosphorus reduced species richness further, but the biggest negative effects were when nitrogen and phosphorus were applied together. The analysis demonstrates how multiple factors contribute to the observed diversity patterns and how environmental regulation of species pools can operate at the same spatial and temporal scale as biomass effects.",

        "Comment": "A rapid method for extracting soil solutions using porous plastic soil-moisture samplers was combined with a cation resin equilibration based speciation technique to look at the chemical availability of metals in soil. Industrially polluted, metal sulphate amended and sewage sludge treated soils were used in our study. Cadmium sulphate amended and industrially contaminated soils all had >65% of the total soil solution Cd present as free Cd2+. However, increasing total soil Cd concentrations by adding CdSO4 resulted in smaller total soil solution Cd. Consequently, the free Cd2+ concentrations in soil solutions extracted from these soils were smaller than in the same soil contaminated by sewage sludge addition. Amendment with ZnSO4 gave much greater concentrations of free Zn2+ in soil solutions compared with the same soil after long-term Zn contamination via sewage sludge additions. Our results demonstrate the difficulty in comparing total soil solution and free metal ion concentrations for soils from different areas with different physiochemical properties and sources of contamination. However, when comparing the same Woburn soil, Cd was much less available as Cd2+ in soil solution from the CdSO4 amended soils compared with soil contaminated by about 36 years of sewage sludge additions. In contrast, much more Zn was available in soil solution as free Zn2+ in the ZnSO4 amended soils compared with the sewage sludge treated soils. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "Comment": "Once phosphorus (P) applications stop, it is important to know how long it will take for plant-available P in soil to decline to a particular level for soils with a history of intensive management. The rate of decline in the absence of applied P can be expressed as a half-life, that is the time in years for it to halve relative to the lowest level measured in the soil. This knowledge is essential when planning long-term policies for managing the P status of soils. It is important to farmers who wish to optimize applications of P fertilizers and make better use of accumulated P residues to ensure that plant-available P does not fall below the critical level for the soil and crop because of the risk of losing yield and the inefficient use of other inputs, especially N fertilizer. Lower levels of plant-available P are also desirable for environmental and ecological reasons. Allowing plant-available P to decline to the critical level from unnecessarily high concentrations will reduce the risk from P on eroded soil causing adverse effects of eutrophication in surface water. Low levels of plant-available P are usually considered necessary for establishing species-rich grassland. A method for determining the longer term decline in plant-available soil P from short-term measured values is presented. ",

        "Comment": "Primers were designed to target 16S rRNA and <i>nodD</i> genes of <i>Rhizobium leguminosarum</i> from DNA extracted from two different soil types contaminated with Zn applied in sewage sludge. Numbers of rhizobia estimated using 16S rRNA gene copy number showed higher abundance than those estimated by both nodD and the most-probable-number (MPN) enumeration method using a plant trap host. Both 16S rRNA gene copies and the MPN rhizobia declined with increased levels of Zn contamination, as did the abundance of the functional gene nodD, providing compelling evidence of a toxic effect of Zn on <i>R. leguminosarum</i> populations in the soil. Regression analysis suggested the total Zn concentration in soil as a better predictor of rhizobial numbers than both NH(4)NO(3)-extractable and soil solution Zn. <i>R. leguminosarum</i> bv. viciae nodD gene copies were generally less sensitive to Zn than <i>R. leguminosarum</i> bv. trifolii <i>nodD</i>. The latter were generally below detection limits at Zn levels of >250 mg kg(-1). Although there were differences in the actual numbers estimated by each approach, the response to Zn was broadly similar across all methods. These differences were likely to result from the fact that the molecular approaches assess the potential for nodulation while the MPN approach assesses actual nodulation. The results demonstrate that the use of targeted gene probes for assessing environmental perturbations of indigenous soil rhizobial populations may be more sensitive than the conventional plant bioassay and MPN methods.",

        "Comment": "Previous work showed that at soil P concentrations below 57 mg 0.5 M NaHCO3-extractable P (Olsen P) kg(-1) soil, little P was found in drainage waters collected from tile drains set 65 cm below the soil surface in soils from the Broadbalk Continuous Wheat Experiment. Above this soil P concentration (termed the Change-Point) both total P and molybdate-reactive P (MRP) in drainage waters were linearly related to soil Olsen P concentrations. We now need to know if the Change-Point measured on Broadbalk occurs on other soils, and if so, whether a common value applies or if it varies depending upon soil type, management, and site hydrology. We investigated the possibility of 0.01 M CaCl2-extractable P being an indicator of the Change-Point. In all the soils studied, we found that the dynamics of P solubility in CaCl2 closely resembled the dynamics of P solubility in drainage waters of Broadbalk, since very distinct Change-Points occurred under both conditions. However, Change-Points measured following extraction with CaCl2 varied widely between soils, from 10 to 119 mg Olsen P kg(-1) soil. Lysimeter studies showed, with some exceptions, good agreement between Change-Points measured in drainage water and in 0.01 M CaCl2. We therefore suggest that this approach may provide a valid indicator of the soil Olsen P concentration at which significant amounts of P begin to leach from soil to water, provided preferential pathways exist in the subsoil to permit P leaching down the soil profile in drainage water.",

        "Comment": "Given the lack of studies which measured dissolved organic carbon (DOC) over long periods, especially in non-forest habitat, the aim of this study was to expand the existing datasets with data of mainly non-forest sites that were representative of the major soil and habitat types in the UK. A further aim was to predict DOC concentrations from a number of biotic and abiotic explanatory variables such as rainfall, temperature, vegetation type and soil type in a multivariate way. Pore water was sampled using Rhizon or Prenart samplers at two to three week intervals for 1 year. DOC, pH, organic carbon, carbon/nitrogen (C:N) ratios of soils and slope were measured and data on vegetation, soil type, temperature and precipitation were obtained. The majority of the variation in DOC concentrations between the UK sites could be explained by simple empirical models that included annual precipitation, and soil C:N ratio with precipitation being negatively related to DOC concentrations and C:N ratio being positively related to DOC concentrations. Our study adds significantly to the data reporting DOC concentrations in soils, especially in grasslands, heathlands and moorlands. Broad climatic and site factors have been identified as key factors influencing DOC concentrations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Comment": "Soil acidification has negative impacts on grass biomass production and the potential of grasslands to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Through a global review of research on liming of grasslands, the objective of this paper was to assess the impacts of liming on soil pH, grass biomass production and total net GHG exchange (nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and net carbon dioxide (CO2)). We collected 57 studies carried out at 88 sites and covering different countries and climatic zones. All of the studies examined showed that liming either reduced or had no effects on the emissions of two potent greenhouse gases (N2O and CH4). Though liming of grasslands can increase net CO2 emissions, the impact on total net GHG emission is minimal due to the higher global warming potential, over a 100-year period, of N2O and CH4 compared to that of CO2. Liming grassland delivers many potential advantages, which justify its wider adoption. It significantly ameliorates soil acidity, increases grass productivity, reduces fertiliser requirement and increases species richness. To realise the maximum benefit of liming grassland, we suggest that acidic soils should be moderately limed within the context of specific climates, soils and management.",

        "Comment": "Positive priming effect following the incorporation of biochar may partially reduce the biochar-induced soil carbon (C) sequestration. We hypothesize that repeated biochar incorporations induce further priming effect in the soil that was already amended with biochar. Two biochars prepared from Miscanthus giganteus at 350 and 700 A degrees C, at a rate of 50 g C kg(-1) soil, were added into the soil previously received each biochar separately with a pre-incubation of 1.5 years. The second addition of fresh biochar caused 108 and 26.9 mu g CO2-C g(-1) soil of soil C losses, which is the same order but less amount (about 72 and 56%) of C losses as the first biochar addition. This might be due to the depleted soil C after 1.5 years of incubation. Also, it might be attributed to the altered soil microbial community with lower proportions (%) of gram-positive bacteria, and higher proportions of fungi, actinobacteria and gram-negative bacterial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) with repeated biochar addition. Our research provided insights into the second addition of biochar-induced priming effects and responsible PLFAs.",

        "Comment": "A sustainable supply of phosphorus (P) to agricultural soils should maintain soil fertility without jeopardizing the environment. This study analyzed the change in the soil P as a function of the net soil P mass balance, i.e. the input minus removal by the harvested crop. The P available for crops was estimated by the P extracted by ammonium lactate at pH 3.75 (P-AL). First, laboratory and pot-trial data showed that the net change in soil P-AL was only 68% of the change in total soil P, either when P had been added to soil or when P had been mined by plants for 1\u20132\u00a0years, indicating removal to or release from the non-extractable pool depending on the balance. Secondly, data were collated from 33 field trials in Europe with a wide range of cumulative soil P balances (?1200 to +2500\u00a0kg P ha?1) in time spans ranging from 3 to 51\u00a0years. The average change in P-AL across the negative and positive balance was only 27% (95% confidence interval 25\u201330%) of the net balance. The change in P-AL was larger as the net balance increased and as the initial P-AL decreased. The slope of the change versus the balance was smaller as time increased and initial P-AL decreased. The other soil characteristics did not affect these changes, and the model developed was not different for negative or positive P balances. Our results suggest that a steady state P-AL concentration at optimal P supply for crops is obtained at a net P balance of about 1\u201310\u00a0kg P ha?1. The P mass balance of a 51\u00a0year-old trial showed that the aqua regia soluble P of the 0\u201390\u00a0cm layer accounted for only 64% of the net P balances at the surface. This still incomplete P balance could be related to upward P transport by plant uptake from\u00a0>\u00a090\u00a0cm soil layers, lateral P movement in the field, and changes in the soil P fraction that could not be extracted with aqua regia. This study quantified the long-term dynamics of P-AL, which is useful for agronomic and environmental purposes and policy, and pointed out the importance of non-extractable P and vertical P movement.",

        "Comment": "Earthworms are significant ecosystem engineers and are an important component of the diet of many vertebrates and invertebrates, so the ability to predict their distribution and abundance would have wide application in ecology, conservation and land management. Earthworm viability is known to be affected by the availability and quality of food resources, soil water conditions and temperature, but has not yet been modelled mechanistically to link effects on individuals to field population responses. Here we present a novel model capable of predicting the effects of land management and environmental conditions on the distribution and abundance of Aporrectodea caliginosa, the dominant earthworm species in agroecosystems. Our process-based approach uses individual based modelling (IBM), in which each individual has its own energy budget. Individual earthworm energy budgets follow established principles of physiological ecology and are parameterised for A. caliginosa from experimental measurements under optimal conditions. Under suboptimal conditions (e.g. food limitation, low soil temperatures and water contents) reproduction is prioritised over growth. Good model agreement to independent laboratory data on individual cocoon production and growth of body mass, under variable feeding and temperature conditions support our representation of A. caliginosa physiology through energy budgets. Our mechanistic model is able to accurately predict A. caliginosa distribution and abundance in spatially heterogeneous soil profiles representative of field study conditions. Essential here is the explicit modelling of earthworm behaviour in the soil profile. Local earthworm movement responds to a trade-off between food availability and soil water conditions, and this determines the spatiotemporal distribution of the population in the soil profile. Importantly, multiple environmental variables can be manipulated simultaneously in the model to explore earthworm population exposure and effects to combinations of stressors. Potential applications include prediction of the population-level effects of pesticides and changes in soil management e.g. conservation tillage and climate change. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

        "Comment": "The Park Grass Experiment (PGE) is the longest-observed set of experimental plant communities in existence. Although the gross composition of the vegetation was at equilibrium over the 60-yr period from 1920 to 1979, annual records show that individual species exhibited a range of dynamics. We tested two hypotheses to explain why some species initially increased and why subsequently some of these (the outbreak species) decreased again. The study was designed around eight phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs), each containing related species with different dynamics. Our first hypothesis was that persistent increasers and out-breakers have higher intrinsic rates of natural increase than control species (species without trends), allowing them to spread when interspecific competition is reduced by drought. This was tested by measuring establishment and seed production of species in field experiments, with and without interspecific competition Seed production in outbreak species responded more strongly to release from interspecific competition than it did in either of the other groups of species. Our second hypothesis was that outbreak species eventually declined because they lacked the genetic variation necessary to adapt to the novel habitats to which they had initially spread. We tested this by measuring mating systems and genetic diversity in persistent and outbreak species in the PGE. In seven out of seven PICs tested, the outbreak species was more selfing than its persistent relative. There was a significant positive correlation between outcrossing rate and gene diversity. These results support roles for both ecological and genetic traits in long-term dynamics.",

(2) Phenotypic differences in leaf length and number of leaves were demonstrated among the subpopulations. Seedlings of the young subpopulation initially had longer leaves, but this difference was lost within 4 weeks indicating that the difference was probably of maternal or historical origin. The young subpopulation consistently maintained a greater number of leaves across environments and through time, however. These differences indicate that genetic change occurred in the population under natural conditions within c. 200 years. (3) Consistent differences in response to environment and density were also found. The old subpopulation did not show as great a response to increasing temperature as the young subpopulation. Also, biomass of the old subpopulation was unaffected by an increase in density, whereas the young subpopulation showed less growth at increased density. The origin of these differences are probably due to evolutionary change within the extant, seed-producing population rather than genetic change occurring within the seed bank. Differential response to density was not reflected in a difference in relative competitive ability.",

        "Comment": "Factors influencing production of greenhouse gases nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitrogen (N-2) in arable soils include high nitrate, moisture and plants; we investigate how differences in the soil microbiome due to antecedent soil treatment additionally influence denitrification. Microbial communities, denitrification gene abundance and gas production in soils from tilled arable plots with contrasting fertilizer inputs (no N, mineral N, FYM) and regenerated woodland in the long-term Broadbalk field experiment were investigated. Soil was transferred to pots, kept bare or planted with wheat and after 6 weeks, transferred to sealed chambers with or without (KNO3)-N-15 fertilizer for 4 days; N2O and N-2 were measured daily. Concentrations of N2O were higher when fertilizer was added, lower in the presence of plants, whilst N-2 increased over time and with plants. Prior soil treatment but not exposure to N-fertiliser or plants during the experiment influenced denitrification gene (nirK, nirS, nosZI, nosZII) relative abundance. Under our experimental conditions, denitrification generated mostly N-2; N2O was around 2% of total gaseous N-2+N2O. Prior long-term soil management influenced the soil microbiome and abundance of denitrification genes. The production of N2O was driven by nitrate availability and N-2 generation increased in the presence of plants.",

        "Comment": "Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) plants were grown in split pots in three Rothamsted soils with different soil pH values and phosphorus (P) contents. Ammonium addition resulted in higher plant dry weight and P content than comparable nitrate treatments. The pH of soils in the rhizosphere (0.51-mm average thickness) differed from the bulk soil depending on nitrogen (N) form and level. Ammonium application resulted in a pH decrease, but nitrate application slightly increased pH. To examine the effect of rhizosphere acidification on mobilization of phosphate, 0.5 M NaHCO3 extractable phosphate was measured. The lowering rhizosphere pH enhanced the solubility of P in the soil and maybe availability of P to plants. Rhizosphere-P depletion increased with increasing ammonium supply, but when N was supplied as nitrate, P depletion was not related to increasing nitrate supply. Low P status Hoosfield soils developed mycorrhizal infection., and as a result, P inflow was increased. Geescroft soil, which initially had a high P status, did not develop mycorrhizal infection, and P inflow was much smaller and was unaffected by N treatments. Therefore, plant growth and P uptake were influenced by both rhizosphere pH and indigenous mycorrhizal infection.",

        "Comment": "Losses of fertilizer as NO and N2O were studied at Broadbalk field, Rothamsted Experimental Station in England, on which subplots have been subject to differing constant levels of fertilizer application for many years. Fluxes of NO and N2O were measured using open- and closed-chamber techniques, respectively. Fluxes from unfertilized soil ranged from 0.3 to 4.8 ng N m(-2) s(-1) for NO and 0.23 to 3.0 ng N m(-2) s(-1) for N2O. The corresponding fluxes from the plot with the highest fertilizer application (92 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) as NH4NO3) ranged from 0.5 to 64 ng N m(-2) s(-1) for NO and 0.4 to 240 ng N m(-2) s(-1) for N2O. Application of increasing amounts of fertilizer substantially enhanced emission rates of both NO and N2O. However, the amount of increase was controlled by competition between the crop and the microorganisms for the available soil nutrients, and loss of N2O to the atmosphere increased sharply at superoptimal levels of fertilizer application. The fertilizer-derived NO and N2O emissions represented approximately 90% of the total emission of these gases during the 25-day sampling period after fertilizer application. The results suggest that while increasing the amount of fertilizer increases both NO and N2O fluxes simultaneously, the NO N2O emission ratio decreases. Results from laboratory experiments showed that the magnitude of the fertilizer loss as N2O was strongly affected by the form of the applied fertilizer.",

Analysis of Cd was by Zeeman correction GFAAS following a nitric acid digestion. The data are compared with those from control plots which have not received superphosphate. On the unlimed plots, levels of Cd in the herbage from the phosphate-treated plot were very similar to those on the control for the years to 1930; whereas from 1940 to the present, the Cd concentrations in herbage were considerably greater on the phosphate-treated plot. On the limed plots, Cd concentrations in the herbage from both the phosphate-treated and control plots have remained similar to each other, although both plots exhibit a small increase of about 1 mu g of Cd kg(-1) year(-1) since the beginning of the liming treatment in 1903",

        "DOI": "Two experiments on the value of the residues of phosphate fertilizers on sandy loam soil at Woburn [England] are described. One experiment was sited on plots of the Continuous Wheat and Barley experiments (1876-1966) on Stackyard field and the other on plots of the Market Garden experiment (1942-67) on Lansome field. Soils on Stackyard contained 0.65% C in 1967 and small amounts of soluble P; those on Lansome contained 1.06-2.20% C and amounts of soluble P increased as soil C increased. In 1967 superphosphate was applied at 4 rates (82, 164, 328 and 492 kg P ha-1) to plots in the Stackyard experiment (previously unmanured) to increase the levels of soil P. The amounts of P in the soils of the Lansome experiment were not increased by adding superphosphate after 1967. To test the effects of applying fresh superphosphate to the crops during 1970-72, main plots were halved in the Stackyard experiment while on Lansome 1/2 the plots received fresh P. During 1968 and 1969 both potatoes ('Majestic') and barley ('Maris Badger') were grown on Stackyard each year but only field beans on Lansome. Both experiments were divided into 2 series between 1970-72 and 2 crops were grown each year. The rotation was barley ('Julia'), potatoes ('Pentland Crown') and sugar beet ('Klein E') on 1 series and sugar beet, barley and potatoes on the other. The amounts of fresh P tested on each crop were barley (27.5 kg P ha-1), potatoes (82 kg P ha-1) and sugar beet (55 kg P ha-1). All plots were sampled in autumn 1967 (Lansome) and autumn 1968 (Stackyard) and in spring each year from 1970-1972 before planting and the soils analyzed for NaHCO3-soluble P. In 1967, the NaHCO3-soluble P in the soils 18, 140 was 11-18 mg P kg-1 soil on Stackyard and 140-200 mg P kg-1 soil on Lansome. The yields and the responses of the crops are discussed mainly in relation to NaHCO3-soluble P in the soils. Changes in the soluble P in the soils are also related to the net gains of P by the soils (amounts of P added minus amounts removed). Barley yields on Stackyard increased as the amount of NaHCO3-soluble P in the soils increased up to 30 mg P kg-1; larger crops were grown with freshly applied superphosphate only on soils containing less than 22 mg P kg-1. Yields of grain increased by 0.066 t [tons] ha-1 for an increase in NaHCO3-soluble P of 1 mg P kg-1 in soils containing 16-20 mg P kg-1 and by 0.024 t ha-1 for each increase of 1 mg P kg-1 in soils containing 20-30 mg NaHCO3-soluble P kg-1 soil. Yields of barley grain were up to 1.5 t ha-1 more on Lansome than on Stackyard and increased further (+ 0.2 t ha-1) on plots given 27.5 kg P ha-1. Most of the increase in yields appears to be due to some effect of the extra organic matter in Lansome soils. Potato yields on Stackyard increased consistently with the amounts of NaHCO3-soluble P in the soils up to 30 mg P kg-1 but were depressed at higher soil P levels. When crops were grown with fresh superphosphate broadcast before planting (82 kg P ha-1) larger yields were obtained only on soils containing less than 34 mg P kg-1. Increases in yield from an increase of 1 mg P kg-1 NaHCO3-soluble P were about 0.7 t ha-1 on soils containing 16-20 mg P kg-1 NaHCO3-soluble P and 0.5 t ha-1 on soils containing 20-30 mg P kg-1. The largest yields on Lansome were about 20 t ha-1 more than on Stackyard and yields increased by the same amount (0.4 t ha-1) for each 1 mg P kg-1 increase in soluble P on Lansome and on Stackyard. Freshly applied superphosphate (82 kg P ha-1) increased yields on average by 4 t ha-1. Potatoes appeared to benefit greatly from the extra organic matter and soluble P in the soils on Lansome field. Yields of sugar on Stackyard increased as the amount of NaHCO3-soluble P in the soils increased up to 32 mg P kg-1 and decreased at higher soil P values. The mean increase in sugar yields was 0.07 t ha-1 for each mg P kg-1 NaHCO3-soluble P on soils containing 14-22 mg P kg-1 soluble P. Sugar yields were increased by 0.2-0.3 t ha-1 by fresh superphosphate on soils containing 17-21 mg NaHCO3-soluble P kg-1 soil. O.",

        "Comment": "Although acid soils are common in forest ecosystems, and there is documented evidence of pH influencing transformations of organic matter in soil, there are surprisingly few studies on the influence of soil pH on the chemical structure of physically fractionated soil organic matter (SOM). The aim of this study was to characterize the influence of pH on the chemical and physical processes involved in SOM stabilization. Forest soils of different pH (4.4 and 7.8) sampled from two long-term experiments at Rothamsted Research (UK) were physically fractionated. The free light fraction (FLF), the intra-aggregate light fraction and the fine silt and clay (S + C, <25 mu m) were characterized using elemental, isotopic (delta C-13), thermogravimetric, differential thermal, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy and high-resolution magic angle spinning H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance analyses. The quantitative distribution of carbon (C) between SOM fractions differed between the two soils. Carbon contents in the light fractions from the acid soil were significantly greater than in those of the alkaline soil. In contrast, in S + C fractions, C content was greater in the alkaline soil. FLF from the acid soil was characterized by a greater C:N ratio, smaller delta C-13 and greater content of thermo-labile compounds compared with FLF from the alkaline soil. In contrast, there was only a weak effect of soil pH on the chemical composition of the organic matter in S + C fractions. Irrespective of soil pH, these latter fractions contained mainly aliphatic compounds such as carbohydrates, carboxylic acid, amide and peptide derivates.

        "Comment": "Archived soil samples are a valuable source for retrospective ecological studies, and their recent analysis using molecular ecological approaches has drawn significant attention within the scientific community. However, the possibility of addressing ecological questions regarding detectable microbiota in dried and extensively stored soils has not yet been fully evaluated. To achieve this, soil samples collected from two long-term grassland experiments in the United Kingdom and The Netherlands were subjected to air-drying at 40-42 degrees C and stored at room temperature. Total bacterial, Bacillus benzoevorans-related and eukaryotic communities associated with these samples were analyzed by DGGE-fingerprinting of PCR-amplified ribosomal RNA gene fragments. Changes in microbial community structure due to drying and storage were evaluated by multivariate analysis in relation to changes caused by other environmental conditions, such as soil pH, type of fertilizer and vegetation. Soil drying and storage affected the detectable community structure, but did not materially impair our capacity to identify the effect of soil parameters studied in long-term grassland experiments. Although, in some cases, the amplitude of the influence of a given parameter changed due to sample preservation, analyses revealed that pH, fertilization and soil type significantly influenced microbial community structure in the analyzed samples.

        "Comment": "The turnover of soil inorganic carbon (SIC) is considered slowly and its role in carbon sequestration and climate change is limited. Therefore, the role of SIC in croplands to the global carbon cycle is rarely investigated. In recent years, more evidences have indicated that the turnover rate of SIC is much faster than was thought. This suggests that its roles in stabilizing soil fertility, global carbon pool, and regulating the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere should not be ignored. Therefore, we have reviewed recent advances on SIC in croplands, paying special emphasis on the important role of SIC in sequestrating carbon and buffering soil pH. SIC loss in China induced by agricultural production, especially the application of nitrogen (N) fertilizers affects the health of croplands by accelerating soil acidification and increasing the risk of heavy metals pollution. Soils in the transition zones between the North and the South China (Qinling Huaihe River), brown soil and alluvial soil in the Shandong Peninsula, black soil and chernozem in Northeast China, have low carbonates and a vulnerable pool of SIC that is easily lost. Thus, we suggest that these regions should be designated as SIC loss vulnerable zones. For further studies, the following topics should be considered (i) understanding the fates of SIC and interactions of soil organic carbon-CO2-Ca-SIC in cropland induced by agricultural production, especially adding N fertilizers; (ii) SIC roles in carbon soil balance and cycle; and (iii) regular monitoring of the SIC content in the vulnerable zones. Also, for a sustainable reduction of SIC loss induced by soil acidification, the following measures should be considered: adequate application of N fertilizers, combining the application of N fertilizers with organic fertilizer and nitrification inhibitors and replacing the ammonium bearing fertilizers with nitrate fertilizer.",

        "Comment": "The effects of acidification on the soil chemistry and plant availability of the metals Pb, Cd, Zn, Cu, Mn and Ni in new and archived soil and plant samples taken from the >100-year-old experiments on natural woodland regeneration (Geescroft and Broadbalk Wildernesses) and a hay meadow (Park Grass) at Rothamsted Experimental Station are examined. We measured a significant input of metals from atmospheric deposition, enhanced under woodland by 33% (Ni) to 259% (Zn); Pb deposition was greatly influenced by vehicle emissions and the introduction of Pb in petrol. The build up of metals by long- term deposition was influenced by acidification, mobilization and leaching, but leaching, generally, only occurred in soils at pH<4. Mn and Cd were most sensitive to soil acidity with effective mobilization occurring at pH 6.0-5.5 (0.01 M CaCl2), followed by Zn, Ni and Cu at pH 5.5-5.0. Pb was not mobilized until pH<4.5. Acidification to pH 4 mobilized 60-90% of total soil Cd but this was adsorbed onto ion exchange surfaces and or complexed with soil organic matter. This buffering effect of ion exchange surfaces and organic matter in soils down to pH 4 was generally reflected by all the metals investigated. For grassland the maximum accumulation of metals in herbage generally corresponded to a soil pH of 4.0. For woodland the concentration of Pb, Mn and Cd in oak saplings (Quercus robur) was 3-, 4- and 6-fold larger at pH 4 than at pH 7. Mature Oak trees contained 10 times more Mn, 4 times more Ni and 3 times more Cd in their leaves at pH 4 than at pH 7. At pH values <4.0 on grassland the metal content in herbage declined. Only for Mn and Zn did this reflect a decline in the plant available soil content attributed to long-term acid weathering and leaching. The chief cause was a long-term decline in plant species richness and the increased dominance of two acid-tolerant, metal-excluder species.",

        "Comment": "Soil delivers fundamental ecosystem functions via interactions between physical and biological processes mediated by soil structure. The structure of soil is also dynamic and modified by natural factors and management intervention. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different cropping systems on soil structure at contrasting spatial scales. Three systems were studied in replicated plot field experiments involving varying degrees of plant-derived inputs to the soil, viz. perennial (grassland), annual (arable), and no-plant control (bare fallow), associated with two contrasting soil textures (clayey and sandy). We hypothesized the presence of plants results in a greater range (diversity) of pore sizes and that perennial cropping systems invoke greater structural heterogeneity. Accordingly, the nature of the pore systems was visualised and quantified in 3D by X-ray Computed Tomography at the mm and ?m scale. Plants did not affect the porosity of clay soil at the mm scale, but at the ?m scale, annual and perennial plant cover resulted in significantly increased porosity, a wider range of pore sizes and greater connectivity compared to bare fallow soil. However, the opposite occurred in the sandy soil, where plants decreased the porosity and pore connectivity at the mm scale but had no significant structural effect at the ?m scale. These data reveal profound effects of different agricultural management systems upon soil structural modification, which are strongly modulated by the extent of plant presence and also contingent on the inherent texture of the soil.",

        "Comment": "The anticipated increases in environmental variability associated with climate change may lead to enhanced abiotic plant stresses (e.g., heat stress, drought stress, etc.) resulting in greater inter?annual yield fluctuations and higher crop production risk. While there has been in?creasing attention to adaptation measures, there is little evidence available on how to change ag?ronomic management strategies to maintain stable yields in winter rye production systems in Po?land. This study uses rye yields from the unique Skierniewice Long?term experiment (Poland) to examine for the first?time the long?term effects of different nutrient regimes on crop yield stability from 1966 to 2015. Yields from six combinations of mineral fertilizers and lime (CaNPK, NPK, CaPK, CaNK, CaNP, Ca), with and without additional manure, were used to estimate the temporal yield variability of winter rye. A novel statistical approach based on a mixed model approach with REML (restricted maximum likelihood) stability parameter estimation was used. The results showed that the use of additional manure in \u2018sub?optimal\u2019 mineral fertilizer treatments, such as Ca and CaPK (without mineral N), reduced the temporal yield variability of rye. In contrast, additional organic input led to more variable rye yields in already \u2018optimal\u2019 treatments including mineral N (CaNPK and NPK), compared to those with no additional manure. Winter rye given CaNPK and NPK, without additional organic manure demonstrated high yield and low temporal yield variability. In contrast, yields of treatments with no mineral N (Ca and CaPK) and no additional manure supply were low and unstable. In addition, it was found that increasing soil organic carbon resulted in larger, more stable yields. These findings highlight the importance of ensuring rye crops receive sufficient fertilizer to maintain crop production levels and yield stability, especially in dry years. They also demonstrate the importance of avoiding the excessive use of organic manures when fertilizer inputs are sufficient to meet crop demand. Overall, the study provides novel in?sights about how to maintain grain yields and minimize temporal yield variation of rye in arable cropping systems, which will become increasingly important in a changing climate in Poland and in other temperate climate areas. This study also highlights the importance of soil organic carbon for improving the climate resilience of winter rye, while simultaneously meeting the demand for more sustainable management of the soil.

        "Comment": "Three experiments on winter wheat, each lasting 5 years and on different soil types, were used to test the effects of incorporating different amounts of straw, mainly to determine the importance of achieving uniform distribution to avoid adverse effects on grain yield. Decreases in crop growth and/or grain yield as a consequence of incorporating straw were detected in the first year. The decreases were much larger in one experiment where straw was imported and applied to soil that had been fallowed for 12 months before sowing the wheat than in the other two where the straw was incorporated following the harvest of a winter wheat crop. Tn the subsequent 4 years, incorporating up to 20 t straw/ha had no significant effects on grain yield but there were some significant effects on concentrations and uptakes of N, P and K, especially on the heavier textured soils. The effects on crop growth and yield that were detected in the first year on each site are tentatively attributed to decreases in available N representing that which was required to support the decomposition of the incorporated straw. The relative lack of significant effects in subsequent years seems to imply that a significant proportion of this N was remineralized relatively quickly. and thus available to support the decomposition of the straw that was incorporated in the second year and. after further recycling, in the years after that. Eyespot, caused by the fungus Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides, was decreased by incorporating straw but there were few; significant effects on other diseases. The results provide a generally reassuring message for farmers in suggesting that on most, if not all, soils there is little cause for concern about the consequences of incorporating even large amounts of wheat straw before sowing a further crop of winter wheat.",

        "Comment": "Disposal methods for straw from continuous winter wheat were tested on two soil types, a flinty silty clay loam and a sandy loam, over 7 years (1985-91). The methods tested were burnt or chopped straw in full factorial combination with four cultivation methods (tined to 10 cm, tined to 10 cm then to 20 cm; ploughed to 20 cm; tined to 10 cm then ploughed to 20 cm). Measurements were taken to determine the effects on crop establishment and growth, pest and disease incidence, and the consequent effects on yield. Another experiment (1985-91) on the flinty silty clay loam site, investigated the interactions between straw treatments (burnt, baled or chopped in plots that were all shallow cultivated to 10 cm) and five other factors; namely, time of cultivation, insecticides, molluscicides, fungicides and autumn nitrogen. All the straw x cultivation systems allowed satisfactory crops to be established but repeated incorporation of straw using shallow, non-inversion cultivations resulted in very severe grass-weed problems. Early crop growth, as measured by aboveground dry matter production, was frequently decreased by straw residues, but the effect rarely persisted beyond anthesis. Pests were not a problem and their numbers were not greatly affected either by straw or cultivation treatments, apart from yellow cereal fly which, especially on the heavier soil, was decreased by treatments which left much straw debris on the soil surface. Incorporating straw also caused no serious increases in the incidence of diseases. Indeed, averaged over all sites and years, eyespot and sharp eyespot were both slightly but significantly less severe where straw was incorporated than where it was burnt. Eyespot, and even more consistently sharp eyespot, were often more severe after ploughing than after shallow, non-inversion cultivations. Effects on take-all were complex but straw residues had much smaller effects than cultivations. Initially the disease increased most rapidly in the shallow cultivated plots but these also tended to go into the decline phase more quickly so that in the fourth year (fifth cereal crop) take-all was greater in the ploughed than in the shallow cultivated plots. On average, yields did not differ greatly with straw or cultivation systems, although there were clear effects of take-all in those years when the disease was most severe. In the last 2 years, yields were limited by the presence of grass weeds in th plots testing chopped straw incorporated by tining to 10 cm.",

        "Comment": "Concentrations of amino acids were measured in hydrolysates of manured and unmanured soil samples collected in 1876 and 1959 from the Park Grass experiment, and in 1964 from the Broadbalk Wilderness plots. at Rothamsted, England. Discriminant analysis separated successfully the Park Grass treatment groups after the effect of absolute amino acid concentration had been removed. The same statistical procedure was used to compare samples of soil from the Park Grass and previously published data from the Broadbalk continuous wheat experiments. These comparisons suggest that an amino acid 'fingerprint' can distinguish between grassland and arable treatments. Further comparisons suggest that the Wilderness wooded soil fingerprint is distinguishable from both grassland and arable, but that the Wilderness grassland (rough grass) fingerprint is more like the (Park) grassland than either the Wilderness wooded or the arable fingerprints.

        "Comment": "The oxidation of atmospheric methane (CH4) by soil methanotrophic bacteria constitutes the only biological sink for this greenhouse gas. However, anthropogenic activities, in particular N fertilization, often (but not always) reduce this sink, by mechanisms only partly understood. We argue that the difficulty in developing a process-based understanding of the mechanisms involved is. in part, due to complex interactions with environmental conditions and N cycling, in combination with a lack of information on how the involved processes and organisms are organized within soil structure. We have developed a novel method which permits mapping of the spatial distribution of the active soil methanotrophs at a resolution well below 100 mu m. In the present study, we applied this technique to a selection of plots from the Park Grass experiment at Rothamsted, UK, to which either no fertilizer, or (NH4)(2)SO4. NaNO3, or manure were applied for over 150 years. We measured the spatial distribution of CH4 assimilation four times throughout the 2008 growing season, together with field-based measurements of the soil CH4 sink. In general, methanotrophic activity was most pronounced within the top 10 cm of soil, and along the surface of aggregates and pore channels. Soil CH4 oxidation was controlled by soil moisture, with no differences between the plots after correcting for differences in soil moisture within the field site. Exceptions were on the (NH4)(2)SO4-treated plots in which acidification had occurred due to no or little liming. In these plots, methanotrophic activity was restricted to spots in deeper soil layers, which contributed only little to the sink for atmospheric CH4 due to diffusive limitation of the top soil layers. Our results suggest that spatial distribution of CH4 assimilation is controlled by local concentrations of N-4(+) and/or pH within the soil structure. The effect of pH may be direct, or indirect through a reduction in nitrification rates and therefore increased NH4+ concentrations, or indirect through a mobilization of Al3+ which also might reduce methanotrophic activity. The concentration of ammonium ions, and their persistence in soil, will depend on the quantity of N applied, its rate of release through mineralization, and its rate of removal by either plant or microbial assimilation or nitrification. Our findings underline the importance of developing a detailed understanding of the spatial organisation of these processes since this will determine the nature and strength of their interactions. The technique we have shown here provides a powerful tool to achieve this goal. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "Comment": "The largest yields of wheat and potatoes came from the combination of longer ley plus optimum fertilizer N but yields of winter beans were decreased where N had been given to the previous crops. Without fertilizer N, two year old leys significantly increased yields compared to one year leys and the effect of longer leys was small except for the first wheat, when grain yields were large and plateaued after the three year ley. Exponential response curves were fitted to the wheat yields and an exponential plus linear trend to the potato yields after each of the leys. Maximum yields and maximum economic yields and their associated N dressings were then estimated. Maximum economic yields of wheat in 1987 ranged from 8.11 to 9.14 t/ha grain and the fertilizer N needed declined from 174 kg/ha after the one year ley to 48 kg/ha after the six year ley. For potatoes in 1988, yields ranged from 63 to 71 t/ha tubers but the N required (137-150 kg/ha) varied little with ley age. For winter wheat, in 1989 yields ranged from only 5.51 to 6.99 t/ha grain, because of drought but, as with the potatoes, the N required (203-218 kg/ha) varied little. For each crop the six individual N response curves could be shifted to bring them into coincidence, and the benefits of the ley estimated in terms of a quantity of fertilizer N applied in spring (horizontal shift) and effects other than spring N (vertical shift). The spring N effects relative to the one year ley varied with ley age; for the first wheat the range was from 6 to 126 kg N/ha for the two to six year leys respectively. Spring N effects were negligible, however, for potatoes (average 6 kg/ha) and also for wheat in the third year (.6 kg/ha). Benefits other than those which could be ascribed to spring-N increased yield of the first wheat, on average, by 0.94 t/ha grain for the two to five year leys; for potatoes they ranged from 3.5 to 8.1 t/ha tubers for the three to six year leys; for the third crop wheat they ranged from 0.86 to 1.49 t/ha grain for the three to six year leys. On average the first wheat recovered only 34% of the applied fertilizer N whilst potatoes and the following wheat recovered 55 and 56% respectively. There was a benefit from the longer leys which affected the efficiency with which fertilizer N was used. Increasing ley age up to five years increased total soil carbon by a maximum of 0.17% C; 18% of the carbon content of the soil in the one year ley plots. This small increase in soil organic matter provided up to 230 kg/ha mineral N in the first autumn after ploughing. Between 17 October 1986 and 27 April 1987 the average loss of NO3-N from soils following three to six year leys was equivalent to 202 kg N/ha, whilst the average uptake of N by 11 May in the above-ground wheat was only 88 kg/ha; the net loss was 114 kg N/ha. A computer simulation, which included mineralization of organic N during this period together with N uptake and nitrate leaching losses, computed a loss of 250 kg N/ha following the six year ley, and this would have given 400 mg NO3/l in the 275 mm through drainage that winter.",

The Broadbalk samples showed increased amino acids, acetate, and choline and decreased fructose and succinate with increasing nitrogen fertilization. Samples receiving farm yard manure had similar grain nitrogen to those receiving 96 kg of N/ha but had higher contents of amino acids, sugars, and organic acids. A comparison of the profiles of grain from organic and low-input systems showed only partial separation, with clear effects of climate and agronomy. However, supervised multivariate analysis showed that the low-input samples had higher contents of many amino acids, raffinose, glucose, organic acids, and choline and lower sucrose, fructose, and glycine. Consequently, although differences between organic and conventional grain occur, these cannot be used to confirm sample identity.",

        "Comment": "The composition of soil organic matter (SOM) released during a treatment with base, i.e. a 1 M KOH in 96% methanol solution, from an acidic forest soil was studied using gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. To provide detailed insight into how pH adjustments of the extract obtained can affect the organic matter released, our approach involved: (I) extraction with DCM of the methanol/water extract obtained at pH values ranging from 13 to 1 after direct pH adjustments, (II) sequential acidification of the methanol/water extract obtained and extraction with DCM at pH values ranging from 11 to 1, and (III) acidification after base treatment of the reaction mixture. i.e. soil and extract, to pH 3 followed by a second alkali hydrolysis of the residue and adjustment of the reaction mixture to pH 7. Results obtained after direct pH adjustment of the extract (experiment I) indicated that the relative amounts of identified compounds are. as expected, pH dependent. i.e. based on pK(a) values and hydrophobicity. This phenomenon, which affected significantly the final results, may cause an under or over estimation of certain compound classes and a biased view on ester-related moieties in soils. Direct acidification of base extract in the presence of soil residue (experiment III) indicated that hydrophobic long-chain aliphatic moieties may become associated with the organic matrix left after base treatment, form new, insoluble, organic (macro) molecules or become associated with the inorganic matrix upon acidification of a base extract in the presence of a soil residue, An association with the inorganic soil matrix is discussed as another possible mode of occurrence of ester-related moieties in soil in addition to common known modes of occurrence of ester-related moieties in soils. e.g. the biopolyesters cutin and suberin. A possible contribution of ester-related acid and hydroxy substituted aliphatic monomers, in addition to aliphatic biopolymers, to the precipitate formed at the DCM-water/methanol interface is discussed as well.

        "Comment": "Grassland ecosystems comprise a major portion of the earth's terrestrial surface, ranging from high-input cultivated monocultures or simple species-mixtures to relatively unmanaged but dynamic systems. Plant pathogens are a component of these systems with their impact dependent on many interacting factors, including grassland species population dynamics and community composition, the topics covered in this paper. Plant pathogens are affected by these interactions and also act reciprocally by modifying their nature. We briefly review these features of disease in grasslands and then introduce the 150-year long-term Park Grass Experiment (PGE) at Rothamsted Research in the UK. We then consider in detail two plant-pathogen systems present in the PGE, Tragopogon pratensis-Puccinia hysterium and Holcus lanata-Puccinia coronata. These two systems have very different life history characteristics: the first, a biennial member of the Asteraceae infected by its host-specific, systemic rust; the second, a perennial grass infected by a host-non-specific rust. We illustrate how observational, experimental and modelling studies can contribute to a better understanding of population dynamics, competitive interactions and evolutionary outcomes. With Tragopogon pratensis-Puccinia hysterium, characterised as an \"outbreak\" species in the PGE, we show that pathogen-induced mortality is unlikely to be involved in host population regulation; and that the presence of even a short-lived seed-bank can affect the qualitative outcomes of the host-pathogen dynamics. With Holcus lanata-Puccinia coronata, we show how nutrient conditions can affect adaptation in terms of host defence mechanisms, and that co-existence of competing species affected by a common generalist pathogen is unlikely.",

        "Comment": "The growth and N2-fixation of <i>Trifolium repens</i> was measured in pots, using 15N techniques, on either metal-contaminated or uncontaminated soils which came from field plots which last received sewage sludge (contaminated) or farmyard manure (uncontaminated) more than 20 years ago. Plants grown on sludged soil had lower concentrations of N and smaller yields; the root nodules were small, white, numerous and ineffective in N2-fixation. By contrast, nodules on plants grown on farmyard manure-treated soil were pink (indicating the presence of leghaemoglobin), large and few in number, characteristic of effective nodules. The depressive effect on yield was overcome, at least in the short-term, by adding nitrogen fertilizer to the soil. Concentrations of metals in the leaf material were low and direct phytotoxic effects unlikely. The two soils were mixed in various proportions to test the effects of increasing concentrations of extractable metals in the soil on N2-fixation. A 50% reduction in fixation was observed in soil containing approximately the following concentrations (mg kg?1) of metals extracted by EDTA: 165Zn, 60 Cu, 7.3 Ni and 5.3 Cd. Corresponding \u201ctotal\u201d concentrations (mg kg?1) were 334 Zn, 99 Cu, 27 Ni and 10 Cd. These results are discussed in relation to the current guidelines designed to limit the accumulation of metals in agricultural soils receiving sewage sludge. ",

        "Comment": "During 1899\u20131964 various levels of 0\u00b7 5 M sodium bicarbonate-soluble P had been established in an experiment on a sandy clay loam (pH 6\u00b7 5\u20137\u00b7 0) at Saxmundham, Suffolk. Modification made between 1965 and 1968 widened the range of soluble P values to 3\u201367 mg/kg. Relationships between these soluble P values and yields of potatoes and sugar beet in 1969\u201374 and cereals in 1970\u20137 were assessed. Responses by potatoes and sugar beet to freshly applied superphosphate were also determined at each level of soluble P. Residual effects of these dressings and responses to fresh superphosphate between 1974 and 1976 were measured by barley. Two amounts of N were tested on spring barley in 1976-7 and two cultivars of winter wheat were grown in 1977 and yields related to soluble P. Relationships between yields and soluble P were described by an asymptotic regression equation. This model represented the measured yields well for all crops except barley, in one 4-year-period, when there were insufficient data at low soil P values and a linear regression model was fitted. The asymptotic model was used to estimate plateau yields each year and soluble P values at which yields were less than plateau values by one standard error. Average plateau yields, and associated soluble P values were: potatoes, 43 t/ha and 25 mg P/kg; sugar (from sugar beet) 6-8 t/ha and 20 mg P/kg; spring barley, given 63 kg N/ha, 4-7 t/ha and 25 mg P/kg; barley given 94 kg N/ha, 5-3 t/ha and 33 mg P/kg; winter wheat, 6-5 t/ha and 20 mg P/kg. The model was further used to estimate responses to dressings of superphosphate at three levels of soluble P (9, 15 and 25 mg/kg) in the soils. Yield responses to 55 kg P/ha were 3-9, 2-1 and 1-8 t tubers/ha and 1-1, 0-3 and 0-0 t sugar/ha, for potatoes and sugar beet respectively, at the three levels of soluble P. On impoverished soils (soluble P < 10 mg/kg) even the largest fresh applications of broadcast superphosphate did not raise yields to those achieved on enriched soils (soluble P > 25 mg P/kg) in the absence of fresh phosphate. Soluble P in the soils accounted for much of the within-year variation of yields and estimated reliably and quantitatively the value of phosphate residues derived from both superphosphate and farmyard manure which had been applied in varying amounts and at different times between 1899 and 1976.",

        "Comment": "In the 1950s and 1960s, the near universal aim was to increase food production at almost any cost. The introduction of improved cultivars and chemicals to control weeds, pests and diseases justified the use of more fertilizers. Worldwide, the largest increase was in the use of nitrogen (N), partly because it had the largest effect on yield and partly because large quantities were available once fixed N was no longer required for use in the weapons of war. Many developed countries, however, were comparatively quick to satisfy their food needs by the intensification of local production and imports. Interest then turned to issues related to the impact of this intensified agriculture on the environment. Among the more important issues were the increasing concentrations of nitrate in potable water. Although these increases were, simplistically, related to the increased use of fertilizers, they led to a greater interest in fertilizer use efficiency. Increasing fertilizer use efficiency must be seen as a component of integrated plant nutrient management. Integrated because farmers should consider all nutrient sources available to them when deciding fertilizer rates; management because all decisions will have to be taken at the field level by each farmer. The latter requires guidelines. For N, annual field-specific recommendations will be required because after harvest there is little or no mineral N residue from the fertilizer in the soil to benefit subsequent crops and any nitrate can be readily lost from the soil by leaching and denitrification. For many crops, N use efficiency, determined by the difference method, has improved greatly but there is concern that a significant proportion, perhaps 20% for rainfed cereals and more for paddy rice, of the applied fertilizer N still cannot be accounted for. The difference method for assessing efficiency may not be appropriate for nutrients like phosphorus (P) and potassium(K). Calculating the P or K balance and determining its effect on readily soluble P and K in soil may be more useful. This is because only very small amounts of P and K are usually lost from soil and on many soils, a part, at least, of the residue from each application accumulates as a plant available reserve. Thus;a critical level of readily soluble P and K can be determined for each crop on each soil. The guideline to farmers would be to maintain their soils just above the appropriate critical value and assess the efficiency of different nutrient sources on their ability to maintain readily soluble soil reserves.",

Methods: Endophytes were isolated from wheat grown under six fertiliser conditions in the long term Broadbalk Experiment at Rothamsted Research, UK. Samples were taken in May and July from root and leaf tissues. Results: Root and leaf communities differed in abundance and composition of endophytes. Endophytes were most abundant in roots and the Proteobacteria were most prevalent. In contrast, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, the Gram positive phyla, were most prevalent in the leaves. Both fertiliser treatment and sample time influenced abundance and relative proportions of each phylum and genus in the endosphere. A higher density of endophytes was found in the Nil input treatment plants. Conclusions: Robust isolation techniques and stringent controls are critical for accurate recovery of endophytes. The plant tissue type, plant growth stage, and soil fertiliser treatment all contribute to the composition of the endophytic bacterial community in wheat. These results should help facilitate targeted development of endophytes for beneficial applications in agriculture.",

        "Comment": "Heavy metal pollution of soil and water is often associated with industry, but in this paper we demonstrate that water erosion on agricultural soil which has received only agrochemicals has enriched sediment metal concentrations to toxic levels which breach many accepted standards for soils and sediments. Eight 0.1 ha erosion plots with different cultivation treatments were monitored over a 6 year period for surface runoff, soil loss, and Cr, Cu, Pb, and Ni concentrations. Mean concentrations of these heavy metals were up to 3.98 times higher in the sediment than in the parent soil and in some erosion events the sediment had 13.5 times the concentration of metals in the soil. All the sediment heavy metal concentrations were significantly correlated (p < 0.01) with the clay and silt sized fractions of the sediment and with carbon content. The erosion was a highly selective process enriching the detached material in silt, clay, and organic carbon. This was particularly true in smaller erosion events. Sediment metal concentrations tended to follow the shape of runoff hydrographs, although the pattern changed from storm to storm.",

        "Comment": "Simulation models represent soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics in global carbon (C) cycle scenarios to support climate-change studies. It is imperative to increase confi\u0002dence in long-term predictions of SOC dynamics by reducing the uncertainty in model estimates. We evaluated SOC simulated from an ensemble of 26 process-based C models by comparing simulations to experimental data from seven long-term bare\u0002fallow (vegetation-free) plots at six sites: Denmark (two sites), France, Russia, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The decay of SOC in these plots has been monitored for decades since the last inputs of plant material, providing the opportunity to test de\u0002composition without the continuous input of new organic material. The models were run independently over multi-year simulation periods (from 28 to 80 years) in a blind test with no calibration (Bln) and with the following three calibration scenarios, each providing different levels of information and/or allowing different levels of model fitting: (a) calibrating decomposition parameters separately at each experimental site (Spe); (b) using a generic, knowledge-based, parameterization applicable in the Central European region (Gen); and (c) using a combination of both (a) and (b) strate\u0002gies (Mix). We addressed uncertainties from different modelling approaches with or without spin-up initialization of SOC. Changes in the multi-model median (MMM) of SOC were used as descriptors of the ensemble performance. On average across sites, Gen proved adequate in describing changes in SOC, with MMM equal to average SOC (and standard deviation) of 39.2 (\u00b115.5) Mg C/ha compared to the observed mean of 36.0 (\u00b119.7) Mg C/ha (last observed year), indicating sufficiently reliable SOC esti\u0002mates. Moving to Mix (37.5 \u00b1 16.7 Mg C/ha) and Spe (36.8 \u00b1 19.8 Mg C/ha) provided only marginal gains in accuracy, but modellers would need to apply more knowledge and a greater calibration effort than in Gen, thereby limiting the wider applicability of models.",

        "Comment": "This study examined the environmental impact of different nitrogen (N) fertilizer rates in winter wheat production by using a new life cycle assessment (LCA) method, which was specifically tailored to crop production. The wheat production system studied was designed according to,\"good agricultural practice\". Information on crop yield response to different N rates was taken from a long-term field trial in the UK (Broadbalk Experiment, Rothamsted). The analysis considered the entire system, which was required to produce 1 ton of wheat grain. It included the extraction of raw materials (e.g. fossil fuels, minerals), the production and transportation of farming inputs (e.g. fertilizers) and all agricultural operations in the field (e.g. tillage, harvest). In a first step, all emissions and the consumption of resources connected to the different processes were listed in a Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) and related to a common unit, which is 1 ton of grain. Next a Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) was done, in which the inventory data are aggregated into indicators for environmental effects, which included resource depletion, land use, climate change, toxicity, acidification, and eutrophication. After normalization and weighting of the indicator values it was possible to calculate summarizing indicators for resource depletion and environmental impacts (EcoX). At N rates of 48, 96, 144 or 192 kg N/ha the environmental indicator \"EcoX\" showed similar values per ton,of grain (0.16-0.22 Ecox/ton of grain). At N rates of zero, 240 and 288 kg N/ha the EcoX values were 100-232% higher compared with the lowest figure at an N rate of 96 kg N/ha. At very low N rates, 'land use' was the key-environmental-factor, whereas at high N rates 'eutrophication' was the major problem. The results revealed that agronomical optimal arable farming does not necessarily come into conflict with economic and environmental boundary conditions. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

        "Comment": "Long-term ecological observation affords a picture of the past that uniquely informs our understanding of present and future ecological communities and processes. Without a long-term perspective, our vision is prone to environmental myopia. Long-term experiments (LTEs) in particular can reveal the mechanisms that underlie change in communities and ecosystem functioning in a way that cannot be understood by long-term monitoring alone. Despite the urgent need to know more about how climate change will affect ecosystems and their functioning, the continued existence of LTEs is extremely precarious and we believe that dedicated funds are needed to support them. A new non-profit organization called the Ecological Continuity Trust seeks to provide a solution to this problem by establishing an endowment that will be specifically earmarked to sustain LTEs as a scientific tool for the benefit of future generations.

        "Comment": "Insight into the response of cereal yields to nitrogen fertilizer is fundamental to improving nutrient management and policies to sustain economic crop benefits and food sufficiency with minimum nitrogen pollution. Here we propose a new method to assess long-term (LT) regional sustainable nitrogen inputs. The core is a novel scaled response function between normalized yield and total net nitrogen input. The function was derived from 25 LT field trials for wheat, maize and barley in Europe, Asia and North America and is fitted by a second-order polynomial (R2?=?0.82). Using response functions derived from common short-term field trials, with soil nitrogen not in steady state, gives the risks of soil nitrogen depletion or nitrogen pollution. The scaled LT curve implies that the total nitrogen input required to attain the maximum yield is independent of this maximum yield as postulated by Mitscherlich in 1924. This unique curve was incorporated into a simple economic model with valuation of externalities of nitrogen surplus as a function of regional per-capita gross domestic product. The resulting LT sustainable nitrogen inputs range from 150 to 200?kgN?ha?1 and this interval narrows with increasing yield potential and decreasing gross domestic product. The adoption of LT response curves and external costs in cereals may have important implications for policies and application ceilings for nitrogen use in regional and global agriculture and ultimately the global distribution of cereal production.",

        "Comment": "Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration across agroecosystems worldwide can contribute to mitigate the effects of climate change by reducing levels of atmospheric CO2. Stabilisation of organic carbon (OC) in the fine soil fraction (<?20?\u00b5m) is considered an important long-term store of SOC, and the saturation deficit (difference between measured OC and estimated maximum OC in the fine fraction) is frequently used to assess SOC sequestration potential following the linear regression equation developed by Hassink (1997). However, this approach is often taken without any assessment of the fit of the equation to the soils being studied. The statistical limitations of linear regression have previously been noted, giving rise to the proposed use of boundary line (BL) analysis and quantile regression (QR) to provide more robust estimates of maximum SOC stabilisation. The objectives of this work were to assess the suitability of the Hassink (1997) equation to estimate maximum fine-fraction OC in UK grassland soils of varying sward ages and to evaluate the linear regression, boundary line and quantile regression methods to estimate maximum fine-fraction OC. A chronosequence of 10 grasslands was sampled, in order to assess the relationship between sward age (time since the last reseeding event) and the measured and predicted maximum fine-fraction OC. Significantly different regression equations show that the Hassink (1997) equation does not accurately reflect maximum fine-fraction OC in UK grasslands when determined using the proportion of the fine soil fraction (<?20?\u00b5m, %) and measured fine-fraction OC (g?C per kg soil). The QR estimate of maximum SOC stabilisation was almost double that of the linear regression and BL analysis (0.89?\u00b1?0.074, 0.43?\u00b1?0.017 and 0.57?\u00b1?0.052?g?C per kg soil, respectively). Sward age had an inconsistent effect on the measured variables and potential maximum fine-fraction OC. Fine-fraction OC across the grasslands made up 4.5?% to 55.9?% of total SOC, implying that there may be either high potential for additional C sequestration in the fine fraction of these soils or that protection in aggregates is predominant in these grassland soils. This work highlights the need to ensure that methods used to predict maximum fine-fraction OC reflect the soil in situ, resulting in more accurate assessments of carbon sequestration potential.",

        "Comment": "Recently there has been interest in using the velocity of elastic waves to deduce soil physical properties. We wanted to validate the suggestion that the small strain shear modulus has a relatively simple linear relationship with penetrometer resistance. We were also interested in testing published equations for predicting shear wave velocity with an independent data set. Three soils were investigated in this study: a loamy sand soil and two silty clay loam soils. The soils were packed into cores with vertical axial stresses of 30, 200, or 1000 kPa. Following saturation, they were drained to a range of matric potentials between -10 and -500 kPa. After equilibration, we measured the velocities of shear (S wave) and compression (P wave) waves as well as the penetrometer resistances. Our data confirmed a previous proposal that the penetrometer resistance was an approximately linear function of the small strain shear modulus but tested the relationship by direct measurement. The relationships were found to have some sensitivity to soil type. Nevertheless, we show for the first time that there is considerable potential for using S wave velocity to deduce penetrometer resistance with a calibration that is relatively insensitive to soil type. Although estimation of the matric potential with either shear or compression wave velocity was found not to be very accurate, the possibility for estimating the matric potential from an elastic wave velocity given a priori knowledge of the void ratio is an interesting opportunity.",

        "Comment": "Soil moisture is an important component of the Earth system and plays a key role in land-atmosphere interactions. Remote sensing of soil moisture is of great scientific interest and the scientific community has made significant progress in soil moisture estimation using Earth observations. Currently, several satellite-based coarse spatial resolution soil moisture datasets have been produced and widely used for various applications in climate science, hydrology, ecosystem research and agriculture. Owing to the strong demand for soil moisture data with high spatial resolution for regional applications, much effort has recently been devoted to the generation of high spatial resolution soil moisture data from either high-resolution satellite observations or by downscaling existing coarse-resolution satellite-based soil moisture datasets. In addition, land surface models provide an alternative way to obtain consistent high-resolution soil moisture information when forced with high-resolution inputs. The aim of this study is to create and evaluate high-resolution soil moisture products derived from multiple sources including satellite observations and land surface model simulations. The JULES-CHESS simulated soil moisture and satellite-based soil moisture datasets including SMAP L3E, SMAP L4, SMOS L4, Sentinel 1, ASCAT, and Sentinel 1/SMAP combined products were first validated against observed soil moisture from COSMOS-UK, a network of in-situ cosmic-ray based sensors. Second, an approach based on triple collocation was applied to compare these satellite products in the absence of a known reference dataset. Third, a combined soil moisture product was generated to integrate the better-performing soil moisture estimates based on triple collocation error estimation and a least-squares merging scheme. From further evaluation, it is found that the merged soil moisture integrates the characteristics of model simulation and satellite observations and particularly improves the limited temporal variability of the JULES-CHESS simulation. Therefore, we conclude that the triple collocation merging scheme is a simple and reliable way to combine satellite-based soil moisture products with outputs from the JULES-CHESS simulation for estimating model-data fused high-resolution soil moisture for the British mainland.",

        "Comment": "The aim is to assess whether soil microbial biomass carbon (biomass C) could be used as an indicator of environmental change in natural and semi-natural ecosystems. Biomass C was measured by fumigation-extraction in soils from two sites at Rothamsted. One was a plot from the Broadbalk Wheat Experiment, given inorganic fertiliser and chalk, which has been in continuous cultivation for more than 150 yr. The other was a similar sized area, from Geescroft Wilderness, which has been left to revert to woodland since 1885, after being an arable field. Other soil properties (pH, soil organic C and exchangeable cations) were also measured to compare with biomass C. The coefficients of variation (cvs) of the properties measured were calculated for comparison, little difference was found between the cvs for biomass C from each site: cv = 26% for Broadbalk and 23% for Geescroft. The cvs for the other, chemical properties, were mostly < 10% for Broadbalk and generally > 25% for Geescroft, as expected, given the different cultivation histories. Statistical analysis of the variation in biomass C concentration revealed that such measurements would not be valid indicators of environmental change, without processing impossibly large numbers of samples. To decrease the least significant percentage change to less than 5% after three samplings, 320 samples would have to be taken each time. This would be also be true of the other chemical properties in Geescroft Wilderness, where the measured background variation would mask any subtle environmental change. This indicates that, for some properties at least, statistically significant changes will only be detected in the longer term with regular sampling, e.g. 30-40 yr. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

        "Comment": "Repeated patterns, of a type that would be expected to result from limitations to species coexistence (i.e. 'assembly rules') were sought in the Park Grass experiment. This classical grassland experiment was sampled in two years, using replicated biomass samples. Variance in a number of measures was examined, and compared to the variance expected under appropriate null models, the latter based on assumptions of no interactions between species. In each case, an assembly rule would result in low variance. Examining variance in species richness between quadrats within a treatment, there was no indication of constraint on species co- occurrences; variance in richness was actually greater than expected under the null model, attributable to environmental variation or perhaps positive interactions between species. However, there was control on biomass, evidenced by variance in total biomass (i.e. over all species) within a treatment being significantly lower than expected under the null model. There was no indication of community structure based on guilds (i.e. functional, types). Although there was in 1991 some, non- significant, indication of a constant proportion of species from the legume guild, there was no sign of such an effect in 1992. Searches for intrinsic guilds failed to converge. There was no indication at all of constancy in the proportional representation of guilds by biomass. Thus, there is good evidence for competitive control on plant growth, but none for control of species occurrences. There is no convincing evidence for guild structure in this community at the scale sampled. Possible conflict is discussed between the existence of evidence for temporal stability but the absence of evidence for spatial uniformity. It is concluded that most of the mechanisms proposed for temporal stability will not necessarily lead to control on spatial variation. For many mechanisms, this would depend on the spatial scale examined.",

        "Comment": "Soils are fundamental to terrestrial ecosystem functioning and food security, thus their resilience to disturbances is critical. Furthermore, they provide effective models of complex natural systems to explore resilience concepts over experimentally-tractable short timescales. We studied soils derived from experimental plots with different land-use histories of long-term grass, arable and fallow to determine whether regimes of extreme drying and re-wetting would tip the systems into alternative stable states, contingent on their historical management. Prior to disturbance, grass and arable soils produced similar respiration responses when processing an introduced complex carbon substrate. A distinct respiration response from fallow soil here indicated a different prior functional state. Initial dry:wet disturbances reduced the respiration in all soils, suggesting that the microbial community was perturbed such that its function was impaired. After 12 drying and rewetting cycles, despite the extreme disturbance regime, soil from the grass plots, and those that had recently been grass, adapted and returned to their prior functional state. Arable soils were less resilient and shifted towards a functional state more similar to that of the fallow soil. Hence repeated stresses can apparently induce persistent shifts in functional states in soils, which are influenced by management history.",

        "Comment": "Late blight remained a significant disease for potato growers in Europe long after the famine of the 1840s. Of the four mitochondrial haplotypes of <i>Phytophthora infestans</i>, only the Ia mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype has been identified previously in infected potato leaves from famine-era herbarium specimens collected in England, Ireland and Europe in the 19th century. Long-term soil fertility experiments were conducted on potato between 1876 and 1901 in Rothamsted to investigate effects of combinations of organic manures and mineral fertilizers on disease and yield. This report identifies for the first time the same Ia mtDNA haplotype of<i> P. infestans</i> in three diseased tubers from 1877 from the long-term Rothamsted trials, thus providing the earliest evidence of the presence of the founder Ia mtDNA haplotype of <i>P. infestans</i> in potato tubers in England. Soil amendments had a significant impact on disease and yield. A real-time PCR assay was used to detect and quantify <i>P. infestans</i> in tubers. The level of pathogen DNA was greatest in tubers from highest yielding plots that received combinations of inorganic nitrogenous and mineral fertilizers and least in tubers from plots with organic farmyard manures or non-nitrogenous mineral fertilizers. The Ia mtDNA haplotype was also confirmed from diseased potato leaves during the same time period. Thus, the founder Ia mtDNA haplotype survived in potato tubers after 1846 and was present over 30 years later in the UK.",

        "Comment": "The fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici is becoming more difficult to control in NW-Europe. Using archived infected wheat leaf samples from Broadbalk, the long-term winter wheat experiment at Rothamsted, resistance to methyl benzimidazole carbamates and quinone outside inhibitors due to alterations in ?-tubulin (E198A) and cytochrome b (G143A) was detected in 1985 and 2002, respectively. UK field populations have also become less sensitive to azoles due to three different mechanisms, alterations in the target protein sterol 14?-demethylase (CYP51) with the first mutation, Y137F, detected in 1991, CYP51 over-expression (2009) and altered efflux pump activity (2013). All three mechanisms have been found simultaneously in some isolates. Resistance conferring mutations to succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs) have also been detected since 2015, with up to 15 different mutations found in SdhB, SdhC and SdhD in 2017. Two isolates carried two mutations simultaneously, but these strains were not found in subsequent years. Here we present the latest monitoring data from the four most frequently occurring Sdh mutations (SdhC-T79N, C-W80S, C-N86S and C-H152R) in the UK at the start of the season in different geographical regions and late season after selection by different fungicide  programmes. Previous studies and results from our current monitoring studies indicate that isolates carrying C-H152R might harbour a fitness cost. Quantitative detection of the four targeted Sdh mutations show that selection for these mutations was influenced by the dose rate, spray number and mixing partner of SDHI fungicides.",

        "Comment": "Aggregates are functional units to describe the impact of soil structural changes on physical and biogeochemical processes in soil. Both incubation and field experiments have shown that changing agricultural practices could reshape the intra-aggregate structure in a matter of days, but most such data were obtained from a single time-point and it is hence impossible to interpret that such a change was just a temporal transition or the new equilibria towards which the aggregates had evolved following the management changes. Understanding this is indispensable as intra-aggregate structure and its ability to transport substrates modulate all biogeochemical processes involved in soil carbon and nutrient cycle. This paper investigates this using soil samples archived from a reversion experiment initiated in 2008 at Rothamsted Research (UK), where parts of a plot that had been fallow since the 1950\u00a0s were converted to wheat or grass in 2008. We used X-ray Computed Tomography images, acquired at voxel size 1.5\u00a0\u00b5m, of aggregates in the archived soils to investigate the evolution of transport property of the aggregates over time, as well as its relationship with soil organic carbon (SOC). We also evaluated the development of pore connectedness following the conversion. The results show that the transport ability of the aggregates explains the\u00a0SOC change much better than the porosity, and that noticeable changes in porosity of the connected pores and their ability to transport substrates did not emerge until the sixth year after the conversion. Ten years after the conversion, there was still no sign of the porosity of the connected pores and the bulk diffusion coefficient to plateau. In addition, we found the conversion to grass changed the intra-aggregate pore geometry significantly in that the bulk diffusion coefficients of their aggregates trends with their porosities in a way differing significantly from those for the bare fallow and arable treatments. All these suggest that the intra-aggregate reconfiguration following the conversion is a slow process, and that the ability of pore space to transport substrates is more important than the habitat they provide in SOC stabilisation.",

        "Comment": "Land application of farmyard manure (FYM) is a widespread agronomic practice used to enhance soil fertility, but its long-term effects on soil microbial carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling have not been investigated in detail. Topsoils (0\u201323 cm) and subsoils (23\u201338 cm) were collected from a field trial on a sandy-textured soil where FYM had been applied at high (50\u201325 t ha?1 yr?1, 28 yr) and low rates (10 t ha?1 yr?1, 16 yr), and compared to soil treated only with synthetic NPK fertilisers. The turnover rate of key components of soil organic matter (SOM; proteins, peptides, amino acids, cellulose, and glucose) were evaluated by 14C labelling and measuring cellobiohydrolase, ?-glucosidase, ?-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase, L-leucine aminopeptidase, protease, and deaminase activities, whereas gross NH4+ and NO3? production and consumption were determined by 15N-isotope pool dilution. Microbial communities were determined using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiling. Our results indicate that long-term FYM addition significantly enhanced the accumulation of soil C and N, soil organic N (SON) turnover, exoenzyme activity, and gross NO3? production and assimilation. Rates of protein, peptide, and amino acid processing rate were 169\u2013248, 87\u2013147, and 85\u2013305 mg N kgDWsoil?1 d?1, respectively, gross NH4+ and NO3? production and consumption were 1.8\u20135.8 mg N kgDWsoil?1 d?1, and the highest rates were shown under the high FYM treatment in topsoil and subsoil. The half-life of cellulose and glucose decomposition under the high FYM treatment were 16.4% and 31.0% lower than them in the synthetic NPK fertiliser treatment, respectively, indicating higher rates of C cycling under high manure application as also evidenced by the higher rate of CO2 production. This was ascribed to an increase in microbial biomass rather than a change in microbial community structure. Based on the high pool sizes and high turnover rate, this suggests that peptides may represent one of the dominant forms of N taken up by soil microorganisms. We conclude that long-term FYM application builds SOM reserves and induces faster rates of nutrient cycling by boosting microbial biomass rather than by changing its community composition.",

        "Comment": "An experiment with N-15-labelled fertilizer was superimposed on the Rothamsted Hoosfield Spring Barley Experiment, started in 1852. Labelled (NH4)-N-15 (NO3)-N-15 was applied in spring at (nominal) rates of 0, 48, 96 and 144 kg N ha(-1). The labelled fertilizer was applied to microplots located within four treatments of the original experiment: that receiving farmyard manure (FYM) annually, that receiving inorganic nutrients (PK) annually and to two that were deficient in nutrients: applications were made in two successive years, but to different areas within these original treatments. Maximum yields in 1986 (7.1 t grain ha(-1)) were a little greater than in 1987. In 1987, microplots on the FYM and PK treatments gave similar yields, provided enough fertilizer N was applied, but in 1986 yields on the PK treatment were always less than those on the FYM treatment, no matter how much fertilizer N was applied. In plots with adequate crop nutrients, about 51% of the labelled N was present in above-ground crop and weed at harvest, about 30% remained in the top 70 cm of soil (mostly in the 0-23 cm layer) and about 19% was unaccounted for, all irrespective of the rate of N application and of the quantity of inorganic N in the soil at the time of application. Less than 4% of the added fertilizer N was present in inorganic form in the soil at harvest, confirming results from comparable experiments with autumn-sown cereals in south-east England. Thus, in this experiment there is no evidence that a spring-sown cereal is more likely to leave unused fertilizer in the soil than an autumn-sown one. With trace applications (ca. 2 kg N ha(-1)) more labelled N was retained in the soil and less was in the above-ground crop. Where P and K were deficient, yields were depressed, a smaller proportion of the labelled fertilizer N was present in the above-ground crop at harvest and more remained in the soil. Although the percentage uptake of labelled N was similar across the range of fertilizer N applications, the uptake of total N fell off at the higher N rates, particularly on the FYM treatment. This was reflected in the appearance of a negative Added Nitrogen Interaction (ANI) at the highest rate of application. Fertilizer N blocked the uptake of soil N, particularly from below 23 cm, once the capacity of the crop to take up N was exceeded. Denitrification and leaching were almost certainly insufficient to account for the 19% loss of spring-added N across the whole range of N applications and other loss processes must also have contributed.",

        "Comment": "In 1992 and 1993, eight rates of N-15-labelled fertilizer (0-245 kg ha(-1)) were applied to winter wheat growing on the Ropsley long term field trial where eight different N amounts had been applied annually since 1978. The fate of the labelled N in the crop and topsoil (0-23 cm) was determined at harvest in the year of N-15 application and in the first and second residual years. By harvest in the second residual year, 60-77 % of the original labelled application had been recovered in the crop and topsoil with 23-40 % lost. These losses virtually all occurred within the first two growing seasons; there was no significant loss during the second residual year. Significant changes in the N-15 balance were observed at N applications in excess of the range 140-175 kg ha(-1) which suggested a marked decrease in the efficiency of N use and an increase in residual labile N in the soil at harvest. At low N applications (< 175 kg ha(-1)), a positive added nitrogen interaction (ANI) was observed: 40-50 % of this was a residual ANI due to the short or long term effect of applying N fertilizer, and the remainder was probably an apparent ANI due to pool substitution in the immobilization process. At large N applications (> 175 kg ha(-1)) a negative ANI was observed: large N applications resulted in a net suppression of soil N uptake due to substitution by fertilizer for a limited plant N demand.",

        "Comment": "It is often claimed by proponents of organic farming that, if used worldwide, it would provide sufficient food for a growing world population. Here we make a critical assessment of this claim for wheat, a major cereal crop and source of food throughout the world. We have compared organic and conventional systems, examined some of the publications and claims in detail, and found a typical ratio of organic:conventional wheat yields of 0.65. Nitrogen (N) fixation by legumes, the main source of N supply in organic systems, is shown to be much too small and variable to support large and consistent wheat yields. Our conclusion agrees with that of a recent report by the University of Reading\u2019s Centre for Agricultural Strategy that organic agriculture cannot feed the world using current technologies. However, we believe that there is a need to reduce the over-optimal use of fertilisers and agricultural chemicals and to better manage crop rotations to reduce nutrient losses to the environment and crop losses to pests and diseases. There is also a wider societal need to reconsider diet in the context of health and the ability of world agriculture to supply the wants of its anticipated 9 billion population.",

        "Comment": "C-13-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra taken using magic-angle spinning (MAS), cross polarization (CP) and with total suppression of side bands (TOSS) are reported for soils from two long-term field experiments. One set of soils was from the Broadbalk Experiment at Rothamsted, UK (monoculture of winter wheat since 1843) and the other was from the Lermarken site of the Askov Long-Term Experiment on Animal Manure and Mineral Fertilizers (arable rotation since 1894). At both sites soil samples were taken from three fertilizer treatments: nil, inorganic fertilizers, animal manure. Spectra were obtained from whole soil samples and from the size fractions clay (<2 mu m), silt (2-20 mu m) and, in some cases, sand (20-2000 mu m). Comparison of the total strengths of the C-13-NMR signal for each size separate in relation to its total organic C content shows that clay, particularly, contains large percentages of C not detected by NMR because of the large magnetic susceptibilities of the soil minerals. It is proposed that the bi observed signals come from the more labile pools of soil organic matter (SOM), on the presumption that these pools are less closely associated with soil minerals and iron oxides and are likely to be less protected from microbial or enzymic decomposition. For both Rothamsted and Askov, functional groups in the 45-110 ppm region (N- and O-alkyls) dominate in the spectra for whole soils, with aromatics (110-160 ppm) and alkyls (0-45 ppm) signals being the next prominent. In the Askov whole soil samples C-13-NMR revealed no differences between nil, inorganic fertilizer and animal manure treatments but in the Rothamsted whole soil there were some small differences. Clay and silt fractions from Askov contain more alkyls and less aromatics than those from Rothamsted. For both sites clay in enriched in alkyls and depleted in aromatics relative to silt. Clay from Askov, but not Rothamsted, contains more N-alkyls (45-65 ppm) and less acetals (90-110 ppm) than silt. O-alkyls (65-90 ppm) account for more than 20% of the total signal in clay and silt from both sites. Fertilization regimes have not significantly affected the chemical composition of SOM associated with clay- and silt-sized fractions in the soils at either site. We conclude that the chemical composition of SOM is determined primarily by the interaction between the organisms responsible for decomposition and the mineral soil matrix rather than the nature of substrate input.",

        "Comment": "The application of phosphorus (P) fertilizers inevitably contributes to the accumulation of trace elements, such as uranium (U), in agricultural soils. The fertilizer-derived U accumulation was first reported in Rothamsted Research in 1979. In the present study, we expand this early key research by evaluating the fertilizer-derived U accumulation in topsoil (0\u201323 cm) from 1876 to the 2010s. We found that total U accumulation rates ranged from 2.8 to 6.1 ?g U kg?1 yr?1 at the Broadbalk and Park Grass, respectively, being similar to those observed 40 years ago. This highlights that U accumulation is still an ongoing process in Rothamsted. Fortunately, the proportion of fertilizer-derived U did not significantly increase in the ammonium acetate extractable (\u2018proxy\u2019 of plant-available) fraction over 130 years. In addition, we compiled an overview of the global rate of mineral P fertilizer-derived U accumulation in agricultural systems using existing literature (36 experimental trials, from 11 countries). The resulting dataset predicts an estimated mean U accumulation of 0.85 ?g U kg?1 soil for an annual application of 1 kg P ha?1 in the topsoil of agricultural systems (0.26 ?g U kg?1 per kg P ha?1 for arable land and 1.34 ?g U kg?1 per kg P ha?1 for grassland). The annual U accumulation per applied kg P ha?1 being 0.08 (Broadbalk) and 0.17 ?g U (Park Grass) corresponds to around one-third and one-eighth of the worldwide mean U accumulation for their respective agricultural systems, suggesting \u2018relatively\u2019 low U contents of the applied P fertilizers. Our study underscores that fertilizer-derived U accumulation is a persistent problem on the global scale, even if at different rates, and therewith suggests an evaluation of current regulatory limits and acceptable U input levels from P fertilization.",

        "Comment": "Soils store and filter water, prevent flooding, support the production of fuel and fibre, provide habitat, help to create landscape and are a major carbon (C) store. They are, thus, an essential component of supporting, provisioning, regulating and cultural ecosystem services and determinants and constituents of well-being, providing security, the basic material for a good life, health and good social relations. However, calculations based on inherent land quality classes show that fertile soil (that is, soil free of constraints for agricultural production) irregularly covers no more that 12% of the terrestrial land surface. More generally, soil fertility/quality is determined by the interactions between land management interventions by humans and the inherent physical, chemical and biological properties of a soil. Land and soil management based on the understanding of these interactions is one part of delivering food security. Even small changes in C content can have disproportionally large inpacts on key soil properties. Practices to encourage maintenance of soil organic carbon (SOC) are important for ensuring sustainability of most if not all soil functions. This chapter considers the relationship between SOC and soil fertility and structure, ways of increasing SOC, some disadvantages of increasing SOC and two proposed ways on increasing SOC, fertility and sequestering C: the soil application of biochar and the cultivation of deeper rooting crops.

        "Comment": "The migration of cereal aphids and the time of their arrival on winter cereal crops in autumn and spring are of particular importance for plant disease (e.g. barley yellow dwarf virus infection) and related yield losses. In order to identify days with migration potentials in autumn and spring, suction trap data from 29 and 45 case studies (locations and years), respectively, were set-off against meteorological parameters, focusing on the early immigration periods in autumn (22 September to 1 November) and spring (1 May to 9 June). The number of cereal aphids caught in a suction trap increased with increasing temperature, global radiation and duration of sunshine and decreased with increasing precipitation, relative humidity and wind speed. According to linear regression analyses, the temperature, global radiation and wind speed were most frequently and significantly associated with migration, suggesting that they have a major impact on flight activity. For subsequent model development, suction trap catches from different case studies were pooled and binarily classified as days with or without migration as defined by a certain number of migrating cereal aphids. Linear discriminant analyses of several predictor variables (assessed during light hours of a given day) were then performed based on the binary response variables. Three models were used to predict days with suction trap catches >= 1, >= 4 or >= 10 migrating cereal aphids in autumn. Due to the predominance of Rhopalosiphum padi individuals (99.3% of total cereal aphid catch), no distinction between species (R. padi and Sitobion avenae) was made in autumn. As the suction trap catches were lower and species dominance changed in spring, three further models were developed for analysis of all cereal aphid species, R. padi only, and Metopolophium dirhodum and S. avenae combined in spring. The empirical, cross-classification and receiver operating characteristic analyses performed for model validation showed different levels of prediction accuracy. Additional datasets selected at random before model construction and parameterization showed that predictions by the six migration models were 33-81% correct. The models are useful for determining when to start field evaluations. Furthermore, they provide information on the size of the migrating aphid population and, thus, on the importance of immigration for early aphid population development in cereal crops in a given season.",

        "Comment": "In a national survey of the incidence of powdery mildew (Erysiphe betae) in sugar beet in Britain, between 1980 and 1989, in which between 335 and 717 fields were inspected at the end of August each year, the average crop area infected ranged from 2% in 1986 to 68% in 1989. The effect of various climatic factors that might be expected to influence powdery mildew development over this period was examined, using meteorological records from Broom's Barn Experimental Station. Using simple linear regression analyses, a significant association was found between disease incidence and both air temperature and rainfall incidence in the period April-August. However, air temperature and frost incidence in some winter months were also closely associated with the incidence of powdery mildew in the following crop. Combinations of these variables were examined in stepwise multiple-regression analyses. The model of best fit, incorporating winter frost incidence with summer temperature and rainfall incidence, accounted for 95% of the variation. Model validation procedures demonstrated the superiority of this model over those involving single variables. Nevertheless, for forecasting purposes, the best correlation was found between the crop area infected at the end of August each year and the number of days with a ground frost in the preceding February and March. This single climatic variable accounted for 82% of the variation and its potential use to forecast powdery mildew incidence in the national sugar-beet crop is discussed.",

        "Comment": "Over 200 women worked as computing assistants in the Rothamsted statistics department during the twentieth century. They were employed in the analysis of field and laboratory experiments and in the examination of the returns of agricultural surveys. Before World War II they did calculations with pen, paper, slide rules and electromechanical calculating machines, but during the 1950s, when the department underwent an early process of computerisation, their tasks shifted to data processing. Only sparse records exist on the work of these women, and their contribution to the activity of the Rothamsted statistics department has never been assessed, consigning them to invisibility. Combining the literature currently available on laboratory technicians with the one on human computers and data processors, the paper will provide a longue dur\u00e9e perspective (1920s\u20131990) on the work of the female assistants in the Rothamsted statistics department, addressing two distinct aspects. On the one hand it will examine how the tasks of these women evolved with the computing technologies available in the department. On the other hand the paper will reflect on the invisibility of these assistants, who are never explicitly accounted as contributors to the scientific activity of the Rothamsted statistics department, despite being a conspicuous component of its staff.",

        "Comment": "Our understanding of the linkages between plant diversity and soil carbon and nutrient cycling is primarily derived from studies at the species level, while the importance and mechanisms of diversity effects at the genotype level are poorly understood. Here we examine how genotypic diversity and identity, and associated variation in functional traits, within a common grass species, Anthoxanthum odoratum, modified rhizodeposition, soil microbial activity and litter decomposition. Root litter quality was not significantly affected by plant genotypic diversity, but decomposition was enhanced in soils with the legacy of higher genotypic diversity. Plant genotypic diversity and identity modified rhizodeposition and associated microbial activity via two independent pathways. Plant genotypic diversity enhanced soil functioning via positive effects on variation in specific leaf area and total rhizodeposition. Genotype identity affected both rhizodeposit quantity and quality, and these effects were mediated by differences in mean specific leaf area, shoot mass and plant height. Rhizodeposition was more strongly predicted by aboveground than belowground traits, suggesting strong linkages between photosynthesis and root exudation. Our study demonstrates that functional diversity and identity of plant genotypes modulates belowground carbon supply and quality, representing an important but overlooked pathway by which biodiversity affects ecosystem functioning.",

Bacterial growth decreased and fungal growth increased with lower pH, resulting in a 50-fold increase in the relative importance of fungi between pH 7.4 and 3.3. The PLFA-based fungal : bacterial biomass ratio was unchanged between pH 4.5 and 7.4, and decreased only below pH 4.5. Respiration and substrate-induced respiration biomass both decreased three- to fourfold with lower pH, but biomass concentrations estimated using PLFAs were unaffected by pH. N fertilization did not affect bacterial growth and marginally affected fungal growth while PLFA biomass marker concentrations were all reduced by higher N additions. Respiration decreased with higher N application, suggesting a reduced quality of the soil organic carbon. The PLFA composition was strongly affected by both pH and N. A comparison with a pH gradient in arable soil allowed us to generalize the pH effect between systems. There are 30-50-fold increases in the relative importance of fungi between high (7.4-8.3) and low (3.3-4.5) pH with concomitant reductions of respiration by 30-70%.",

        "Comment": "PCDD/Fs and PCBs have been analyzed in a series of archived soil samples collected from various depths during the 1800s and early 1900s. PCBs were not found in soil samples collected before 1900, whereas PCDD/Fs were present in concentrations between 43 and 110 pg/g in surface soils, and between 9 and 150 pg/g in soils collected from below the surface. The PCDD/F homologue patterns of all surface soils were consistent with each other. The homologue pattern of deeper soils altered with depth to one that was dominated by highly chlorinated PCDDs. The highest Sigma (4-8)PCDD/F concentration (150pg/g) was found in the deepest soil analyzed (230-250 cm below the surface). The cork from one of the storage bottles contained considerable quantities of both PCBs and PCDD/Fs. However, contamination of the soils, either by diffusion through the cork or by cork particles, was discounted on the basis that no PCBs were evident in the soil, and that the PCDD/F homologue pattern in the cork was Very different to that found in the soil. Similar arguments were used to discount contamination of the soil by dust. A sample of ashed vegetation from the archive, that had no cork stopper, contained high concentrations of PCBs (78 ng/g), concentrations of mono- to tri-CDFs that were higher than in any of the soils (190 pg/g), but very low concentrations of Sigma (4-8)PCDD/F (12 pg/g). This pattern of analytes was considered to be representative of contamination from store room air and was completely different from the pattern observed in the soils. Taken together these observations indicate that contamination during storage, or subsequent handling, is unlikely to have occurred in archived soil samples that were stored with cork and wax seal intact. The results imply surface soil Sigma (4-8)PCDD/F concentrations of around 60 pg/g at Rothamsted (southeast England) in the late 1800s, compared with similar to 300 pg/g reported for rural UK soils in the 1990s.",

Vill. and Aphanes arvensis L.) growing in the Broadbalk long-term wheat experiment. The experiment is made up of individual plots, to which different fertilizer regimes have been applied annually for more than 150 years. Sixteen polymorphic loci were analysed in the obligate outcrosser A. myosuroides (24 plants sampled on each of four plots); the proportion of total diversity caused by differences between populations (G(st)) was low (0.02). Twelve loci were analysed in the self-pollinating species M. lupulina (24 plants sampled on each of four plots, G(st)=0.12) and S. media (24 plants sampled on each of three plots, G(st)=0.11); and 11 loci in the apomict A. arvensis (24 plants sampled on each of four plots, G(st)=0.19). There was no relationship between the geographic distances separating plots and the genetic distances between samples from the weed populations growing on each plot. Soil fertility had an effect on molecular diversity in S. media: plants growing on low-nitrogen showed divergence from those sampled on high-nitrogen plots, which contained slightly more diversity.",

We analysed the impact of different nutrient regimes on above-ground biomass of angiosperm species with different GS, ploidy level and Grime\u2019s C-S-R (competitive, stresstolerant, ruderal) plant strategies growing at the Park Grass Experiment (Rothamsted, UK), established in 1856. The biomass-weighted mean GS of species growing on plots with the addition of both N and P fertilizer were significantly higher than that of plants growing on control plots and plots with either N or P. The plants on these N + P plots are dominated by polyploids with large GS and a competitive plant strategy. The results are consistent with our hypothesis that large genomes are costly to build and maintain under N and P limitation. Hence GS and ploidy are significant traits affecting biomass growth under different nutrient regimes, influencing plant community composition and ecosystem dynamics. We propose that GS is a critical factor needed in models that bridge the knowledge gap between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.",

        "Comment": "Industrially produced N-fertilizer is essential to the production of cereals that supports current and projected human populations. We constructed a top-down global N budget for maize, rice, and wheat for a 50-year period (1961 to 2010). Cereals harvested a total of 1551 Tg of N, of which 48% was supplied through fertilizer-N and 4% came from net soil depletion. An estimated 48% (737 Tg) of crop N, equal to 29, 38, and 25 kg ha?1 yr?1 for maize, rice, and wheat, respectively, is contributed by sources other than fertilizer- or soil-N. Non-symbiotic N2 fixation appears to be the major source of this N, which is 370 Tg or 24% of total N in the crop, corresponding to 13, 22, and 13 kg ha?1 yr?1 for maize, rice, and wheat, respectively. Manure (217 Tg or 14%) and atmospheric deposition (96 Tg or 6%) are the other sources of N. Crop residues and seed contribute marginally. Our scaling-down approach to estimate the contribution of non-symbiotic N2 fixation is robust because it focuses on global quantities of N in sources and sinks that are easier to estimate, in contrast to estimating N losses per se, because losses are highly soil-, climate-, and crop-specific.

        "Comment": "Previous work has shown that the national average quality of the UK wheat crop from 1974 to 1999 was associated with the preceding winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The association of the winter NAO with the grain quality measure, specific weight, was shown to be mediated by Sunshine duration during grain filling and unconditional wet day probability during grain ripening (the probability of a wet day following either a dry or a wet day), The present study tests the hypothesis that the association between specific weight and the winter NAO can be detected in data from 158 years of the Broadbalk Wheat Experiment at Rothamsted in south-east England. Specific weight from the Broadbalk Experiment responded to sunshine duration during grain filling and unconditional wet day probability during grain ripening in a similar way to the national average data. An association with the winter NAO was found in the Broadbalk data from 1956 to 2001, but not in the previous 112 years (1844-1955). This finding is consistent with other work showing significant correlations between the winter NAO and summer climate only in recent decades. It is concluded that the association between wheat quality and the NAO is a recent phenomenon.",

        "Comment": "The negative effect of increasing atmospheric nitrogen (N) pollution on grassland biodiversity is now incontrovertible(1-3). However, the recent introduction of cleaner technologies in the UK has led to reductions in the emissions of nitrogen oxides, with concomitant decreases in N deposition(4). The degree to which grassland biodiversity can be expected to 'bounce back' in response to these improvements in air quality is uncertain, with a suggestion that long-term chronic N addition may lead to an alternative low biodiversity state5. Here we present evidence from the 160-year-old Park Grass Experiment at Rothamsted Research, UK6, that shows a positive response of biodiversity to reducing N addition from either atmospheric pollution or fertilizers. The proportion of legumes, species richness and diversity increased across the experiment between 1991 and 2012 as both wet and dry N deposition declined. Plots that stopped receiving inorganic N fertilizer in 1989 recovered much of the diversity that had been lost, especially if limed. There was no evidence that chronic N addition has resulted in an alternative low biodiversity state on the Park Grass plots, except where there has been extreme acidification, although it is likely that the recovery of plant communities has been facilitated by the twice-yearly mowing and removal of biomass. This may also explain why a comparable response of plant communities to reduced N inputs has yet to be observed in the wider landscape.",

        "Comment": "To optimise trade-offs provided by future changes in grassland use intensity, spatially and temporally explicit estimates of respective grassland productivities are required at the systems level. Here, we benchmark the potential national availability of grassland biomass, identify optimal strategies for its management, and investigate the relative importance of intensification over reversion (prioritising productivity versus environmental ecosystem services). Process-conservative meta-models for different grasslands were used to calculate the baseline dry matter yields (DMY; 1961\u20131990) at 1km2 resolution for the whole UK. The effects of climate change, rising atmospheric [CO2] and technological progress on baseline DMYs were used to estimate future grassland productivities (up to 2050) for low and medium CO2 emission scenarios of UKCP09. UK benchmark productivities of 12.5, 8.7 and 2.8t/ha on temporary, permanent and rough-grazing grassland, respectively, accounted for productivity gains by 2010. By 2050, productivities under medium emission scenario are predicted to increase to 15.5 and 9.8t/ha on temporary and permanent grassland, respectively, but not on rough grassland. Based on surveyed grassland distributions for Great Britain in 2010 the annual availability of grassland biomass is likely to rise from 64 to 72milliontonnes by 2050. Assuming optimal N application could close existing productivity gaps of ca. 40% a range of management options could deliver additional 21?106tonnes of biomass available for bioenergy. Scenarios of changes in grassland use intensity demonstrated considerable scope for maintaining or further increasing grassland production and sparing some grassland for the provision of environmental ecosystem services.",

        "Comment": "Intact ecosystems contain large numbers of competing but coexisting species. Although numerous alternative theories have provided potential explanations for this high biodiversity, there have been few field experiments testing between these theories. In particular, theory predicts that higher diversity of coexisting competitors could result from greater niche dimensionality(1), for example larger numbers of limiting resources or factors. Alternatively, diversity could be independent of niche dimensionality because large numbers of species can coexist when limited by just one or two factors if species have appropriate trade-offs(2). Here we show that plant coexistence and diversity result from the 'niche dimensionality' of a habitat. Plant species numbers decreased with increasing numbers of added limiting soil resources ( soil moisture, nitrogen, phosphorus and base cations), which is consistent with theoretical predictions that an increased supply of multiple limiting resources can reduce niche dimension. An observational field study gave similar results. The niche dimension hypothesis also explained diversity changes in the classic Park Grass Experiment at Rothamsted. Our results provide an alternative mechanistic explanation for the effects of nutrient eutrophication on the diversity of terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems.",

        "Comment": "White clover plants grown at a site contaminated with heavy metals following applications of sewage sludge were found to have small white root nodules containing ineffective rhizobia (S isolates) which had identical plasmid profiles, unlike the diverse profiles of effective rhizobia from root nodules on adjacent control plots. Our paper supports an earlier suggestion that the ineffective S isolates of <i>Rhizobium</i> from nodules of white clover grown on heavy-metal contaminated soil represent a single strain. These new data include restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) studies using probes specific for a chromosomally-located gene (<i>lac</i>), a plasmid-located symbiotic gene (<i>nif</i>H,D) and a repeated sequence specific for <i>Rhizobium leguminosarum</i> bv. <i>trifolii</i> (RtRS). RFLP patterns of isolates from control plots indicated that although these strains showed variation, they were related to one another but not to the S isolates. We also demonstrated that although the S isolates were ineffective on white clover, they formed normal nodules on subterranean clover, which were effective in nitrogen fixation. However, they ineffectively nodulated red clover and were unable to nodulate <i>Vicia hirsuta</i>. Thus the population of <i>R. leguminosarum</i> bv. <i>trifolii</i> had been radically altered by long-term exposure to heavy metal contamination, apparently losing those agronomically-important strains capable of forming effective symbiotic associations with white and red clover.",

        "Comment": "Interactions between biotic and abiotic processes complicate the design and interpretation of ecological experiments. Separating causality from simple correlation requires distinguishing among experimental treatments, experimental responses, and the many processes and properties that are correlated with either the treatments or the responses, or both. When an experimental manipulation has multiple components, but only one of them is identified as the experimental treatment. erroneous conclusions about cause and effect relationships are likely because the actual cause of any observed response may be ignored in the interpretation of the experimental results. This unrecognized cause of an observed response can be considered a ''hidden treatment.'' Three types of hidden treatments are potential problems in biodiversity experiments: (1) abiotic conditions, such as resource levels, or biotic conditions, such as predation, which are intentionally or unintentionally altered in order to create differences in species numbers for ''diversity'' treatments; (2) non-random selection of species with particular attributes that produce treatment differences that exceed those due to ''diversity'' alone; and (3) the increased statistical probability of including a species with a dominant negative or positive effect (e.g., dense shade, or nitrogen fixation) in randomly selected groups of species of increasing number or ''diversity.'' In each of these cases, treatment responses that are actually the result of the ''hidden treatment'' may be inadvertently attributed to variation in species diversity. Case studies re-evaluating three different types of biodiversity experiments demonstrate that the increases found in such ecosystem properties as productivity, nutrient use efficiency, and stability (all of which were attributed to higher levels of species diversity) were actually caused by ''hidden trearments'' that altered plant biomass and productivity.",

In plots receiving 35kgPha(-1) annually (+P), topsoil As concentrations almost doubled from an initial value of 10mgkg(-1) during 1888-1947 and remained stable thereafter. The phosphate fertilisers used before 1948 contained 401-1575mgAskg(-1), compared to 1.6-20.3mgAskg(-1) in the later samples. Herbage samples from the+P plots collected during 1888-1947 contained significantly more As than those from the-P plots, but later samples did not differ significantly. Mass-balance calculations show that the increase in soil As can be explained by the As input from P fertiliser applications before 1948. The results demonstrate that the P fertilisers used on the Park Grass Experiment before 1948 caused substantial As contamination of the soil.",

        "Comment": "Selenium (Se) intake has decreased substantially in the UK population since 1970s. To investigate whether Se concentration in wheat grain has changed as a result of yield improvement or environmental changes, we analyzed archived wheat grain from the Broadbalk Wheat Experiment at Rothamsted, England, which has been run continuously for over 160 years. Wheat grain and soil samples were selected from plots receiving different fertilizer or manure treatments. Grain Se concentration varied from 11 to 236 ngg(-1), with a mean and median of 44 and 32 ngg(-1), respectively. Grain samples from the unfertilized control plot had significantly higher concentrations of Se than those from fertilized or manured plots; the latter received various amounts of S and also had higher grain yield. No significant trends in grain Se concentrations were detected in the fertilized or manured plots, in spite of a dramatic increase in grain yield since the introduction of modem short-straw cultivars in the mid 1960s. In the control plot, grain samples had higher Se concentrations in the periods before 1920 or after 1970 than those during 1920-1970. This temporal pattern mirrored that of SO2 emissions and atmospheric S deposition. Soil Se concentrations showed an increasing trend in all plots over 160 years. The results show that the Se concentration of wheat grain from the Broadbalk experiment was influenced by S inputs from fertilizers and atmospheric deposition, and that improving grain yield through plant breeding has not resulted in a significant decrease in grain Se concentration in the fertilized plots.

The concentrations of components varied between study years, indicating strong effects of environment. Nevertheless, some trends were observed, with the concentrations of arabinoxylan fibre and soluble sugars (notably sucrose, maltose and fructose) increasing and most amino acids (including asparagine which is the precursor of acrylamide formed during processing) decreasing between the older and newer types. The concentration of betaine, which is beneficial for cardio-vascular health, also increased. The study therefore provided no evidence for adverse effects of intensive breeding on the contents of beneficial components in wheat flour.",

        "Comment": "Long-term trends in iodine and selenium retention in soil, and uptake by herbage, were investigated in archived samples from the Park Grass Experiment, initiated in 1856 at Rothamsted, UK. Soil (0-23 cm) and herbage samples from plots receiving various mineral fertilizers and organic manures, with and without lime, were analysed for selenium (Se) and iodine (I) to assess the effect of soil amendments, annual rainfall, crop yield and changes in soil chemistry from 1876 to 2008. Comparing soil from limed and unlimed control (unfertilized) plots, TMAH-extractable Se and I concentrations both diverged, with time, with greater retention in unlimed plots; differences in concentration amounted to 92 and 1660 mu g/kg for Se and I, respectively, after 105 yr. These differences were broadly consistent with estimated additions from rainfall and dry deposition. Offtake of both elements in herbage was negligible compared to soil concentrations and annual inputs (<0.003% of total soil I and <0.006% of total soil Se). A positive correlation was observed between I and Se concentrations in herbage, suggesting some common factors controlling bioavailability. A growth-dilution effect for I and Se was suggested by the positive correlation between growing season rainfall (GSR) and herbage yield together with soil-to-plant transfer factors decreasing with yield. Phosphate and sulphate fertilizers reduced I and Se herbage concentrations, both through ion competition and increased herbage yield. Results suggest that in intensive agriculture with soil pH control, the I requirement of grazing animals is not likely to be met by herbage alone.",

        "Comment": "Provision of food security in the face of increasing global food demand requires narrowing of the gap between actual farmer's yield and maximum attainable yield. So far, assessments of yield gaps have focused on average yield over 5-10 years, but yield gaps can vary substantially between crop seasons. In this study we hypothesized that climate-induced inter-annual yield variability and associated risk is a major barrier for farmers to invest, i.e. increase inputs to narrow the yield gap. We evaluated the importance of inter-annual attainable yield variability for the magnitude of the yield gap by utilizing data for wheat and maize at ten sites representing some major food production systems and a large range of climate and soil conditions across the world. Yield gaps were derived from the difference of simulated attainable yields and regional recorded farmer yields for 1981 to 2010. The size of the yield gap did not correlate with the amplitude of attainable yield variability at a site, but was rather associated with the level of available resources such as labor, fertilizer and plant protection inputs. For the sites in Africa, recorded yield reached only 20% of the attainable yield, while for European, Asian and North American sites it was 56-84%. Most sites showed that the higher the attainable yield of a specific season the larger was the yield gap. This significant relationship indicated that farmers were not able to take advantage of favorable seasonal weather conditions. To reduce yield gaps in the different environments, reliable seasonal weather forecasts would be required to allow farmers to manage each seasonal potential, i.e. overcoming season-specific yield limitations.",

        "Comment": "The Park Grass Experiment, is an international reference soil with an impressive repository of temperate grassland (meta)data, however, it still lacks documentation of its soil metaproteome. The identification of these proteins is crucial to our understanding of soil ecology and their role in major biogeochemical processes. However, protein extraction can be fraught with technical difficulties including co-extraction of humic material and lack of a compatible databases to identify proteins. To address these issues, we used two compatible soil protein extraction techniques on Park Grass soil, one that removed humic material, namely a modified freeze-dry, heat/thaw/phenol/chloroform (HTPC) method and another which co-extracted humic material, namely an established surfactant method. Proteins were identified by matching mass spectra against a tailored Park Grass metagenome database. We identified a broad range of proteins from Park Grass soil, mainly in \u201cprotein metabolism\u201d, \u201cmembrane transport\u201d, \u201ccarbohydrate metabolism\u201d, \u201crespiration\u201d and \u201cribosome associated\u201d categories, enabling reconstitution of specific processes active in grassland soil. The soil microbiome was dominated by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria and Firmicutes at phyla level and Bradyrhizobium, Rhizobium, Acidobacteria, Streptomyces and Pseudolabrys at genus level. Further functional enrichment analysis enabled us to identify many proteins in regulatory and signalling networks of key biogeochemical cycles such as the nitrogen cycle. The combined extraction methods connected previous Park Grass metadata with the metaproteome, biogeochemistry and soil ecology. This could provide a base on which future targeted studies of important soil processes and their regulation can be built.HighlightsParallel protein extraction methods identified 1266 proteins from Park Grass soilProteome was enriched in ribosomal and respiration proteins for the surfactant extraction method and nitrogen associated proteins for the modified phenol/chloroform methodIdentification of regulatory and signalling proteins in key biogeochemical cyclesLinks metaproteome to microbiome, biogeochemical cycles and Park Grass metadataProvides baseline for future targeted studiesCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",

        "Comment": "The impacts of land-use change and long-term agricultural practices on the bacterial and methanotrophic biomass in the soils comprising the Classical Experiments at Rothamsted Research were investigated by using 13CH(4) phospholipid fatty acid stable isotope probing (PLFA SIP). Nine sites were studied, including six arable plots, two regenerated woodlands and a regenerated grassland. The regenerating sites had all been in arable cropping for at least 200 years (and probably much longer) before commencing regeneration approximately 120 years ago. Six sites were plots within the Broadbalk Wheat Experiment, which had been cultivated, and on which winter wheat was grown annually for 163 years with different fertilizer and manure treatments; the field had been in arable cropping for at least 200 years previously. Triplicate soil samples were incubated under 2 ppmv 13CH(4) for up to 100 days. Extraction and 13C-PLFA analysis revealed that overall methanotrophic biomass was smaller in the Rothamsted soils compared with the other mineral soils studied to date, as indicated by poor 13C incorporation. High-affinity methanotrophs similar to known type II methanotrophs were most abundant in all of the soils studied, except in two plots receiving farmyard manure (FYM and FYM + N). Manuring resulted in a shift to a population similar to known type I methanotrophs. Methanotrophic biomass was elevated in soils that had received the largest input of N fertilizer, though without detectable differences in CH(4) oxidation rates, indicating the potential mediation of atmospheric CH(4) oxidation by non-methanotrophs, which are most likely to be nitrifying bacteria.",

        "Comment": "Economic, political and environmental factors have prioritized the need for research on phosphate (Pi) acquisition efficiency (PAE), Pi use efficiency (PUE) and Pi fertilizer uptake efficiency in crops. However, the coordination of molecular responses to Pi starvation and the mechanisms of Pi starvation tolerance have been investigated predominantly in model plants but remain elusive in grain crops, especially in wheat. This project investigates transcriptional profiles in wheat, particularly in the roots, as a response to nutrient availability focusing on phosphate (Pi). Furthermore, appropriate screening approaches and the difficulties in crop improvement, particularly for wheat, are discussed. Pi acquisition by plants is mediated by members of Pi transporter families. The roles of these Pi transporters in Pi partitioning and re-translocation is complex and the knowledge about their functioning in wheat still limited. Here, members of the Pht1 family in wheat were identified, their expression profiles determined when exposed to different nutrient regimes in roots and ear tissues at various developmental stages and their potential role as targets for genetic improvement discussed. In addition to Pi transporters, regulatory genes including transcription factors, signalling pathways and apparently other Pi-responsive genes with unknown function are also of critical importance. Therefore, the genome-wide responses to limited nutrient availability were investigated for the first time in roots of field-grown wheat exposed to limited nutrient availability resulting in the identification of several candidate genes for PAE/PUE improvement on the molecular level. These data were validated against other studies and across a wider wheat germplasm. Furthermore, the correlation of candidate gene expression to the nutritional status, Pi availability and PAE/PUE properties revealed four potential target genes which may be major contributors to genotypic diversity of this trait. However, there are still some agronomic bottlenecks which impede implementing Pi efficient crops and the application of molecular tools and marker genes.

The Roth-CNP model was developed as part of an Integrated Model (IM) to simulate C, N and P cycling for the whole of UK, by loosely coupling terrestrial, hydrological and hydro-chemical models. The model was calibrated and tested using long term experiment (LTE) data from Broadbalk (1843) and Park Grass (1856) at Rothamsted. We estimated C, N and P balance and their fluxes exported from arable and grassland systems on a 5 km \u00d7 5 km grid across the whole of UK by using the area of arable of crops and livestock numbers in each grid and their management. The model estimated crop and grass yields, soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and nutrient fluxes in the form of NH4-N, NO3-N and PO4-P. The simulated crop yields were compared to that reported by national agricultural statistics for the historical to the current period. Overall, arable land in the UK have lost SOC by ?0.18, ?0.25 and ?0.08 Mg C ha?1 y?1 whereas land under improved grassland SOC stock has increased by 0.20, 0.47 and 0.24 Mg C ha?1 y?1 during 1800\u20131950, 1950\u20131970 and 1970\u20132010 simulated in this study. Simulated N loss (by leaching, runoff, soil erosion and denitrification) increased both under arable (?15, ?18 and ?53 kg N ha?1 y?1) and grass (?18, ?22 and ?36 kg N ha?1 y?1) during different time periods. Simulated P surplus increased from 2.6, 10.8 and 18.1 kg P ha?1 y?1 under arable and 2.8, 11.3 and 3.6 kg P ha?1 y?1 under grass lands 1800\u20131950, 1950\u20131970 and 1970\u20132010.",

        "Comment": "The widespread application of fertilizers has greatly influenced many processes and properties of agroecosystems, and agricultural fertilization is expected to increase even further in the future. To date, most research on fertilizer impacts has used short-term studies, which may be unrepresentative of long-term responses, thus hindering our capacity to predict long-term impacts. Here, we examined the effects of long-term fertilizer addition on key ecosystem properties in a long-term grassland experiment (Palace Leas Hay Meadow) in which farmyard manure (FYM) and inorganic fertilizer treatments have been applied consistently for 120 years in order to characterize the experimental site more fully and compare ecosystem responses with those observed at other long-term and short-term experiments. FYM inputs increased soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, hay yield, nutrient availability and acted as a buffer against soil acidification (> pH 5). In contrast, N-containing inorganic fertilizers strongly acidified the soil (< pH 4.5) and increased surface SOC stocks by increasing the C stored in the coarse (2.8 mm-200 m) and fine (200-50 m) fractions. Application of N fertilizers also reduced plant species richness and the abundance of forbs and legumes. Overall, our results were broadly consistent with those observed in other very long-term studies (the Park Grass and Steinach Grassland experiments) in that fertilization effects on plant and soil properties appeared to be driven by differences in both nutrient input and changes to soil pH. We also established that the direction of long-term fertilization effects tended to be comparable with short-term experiments, but that their magnitude differed considerably, particularly where ammonium sulphate-induced acidification had occurred. We therefore conclude that short-term studies are unlikely to possess the required timeframe to accurately predict long-term responses, thus necessitating the use of long-term study sites. Such experiments should be strategically established in regions where future fertilizer use is expected to increase rapidly.",

The review focuses on two well-studied UK arable crops, wheat and oilseed rape, relating these examples to worldwide food security. In wheat, impacts of changes in concentrations of SO2 in air on two septoria diseases are discussed using data obtained from historical crop samples and unpublished experimental work. Changes in SO2 seem to alter septoria disease spectra both through direct effects on infection processes and through indirect effects on soil S status. Work on the oilseed rape diseases phoma stem canker and light leaf spot illustrates indirect impacts of increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, mediated through climate change. It is projected that, by the 2050s, if diseases are not controlled, climate change will increase yields in Scotland but halve yields in southern England. These projections are discussed in relation to strategies for adaptation to environmental change. Since many strategies take 10-15 years to implement, it is important to take appropriate decisions soon. Furthermore, it is essential to make appropriate investment in collation of long-term data, modelling and experimental work to guide such decision-making by industry and government, as a contribution to worldwide food security.",

        "Comment": "Globally it has been estimated that only one third of applied N is recovered in the harvested component of grain crops. This represents an incredible waste of resource and the overuse has detrimental environmental and economic consequences. There is substantial variation in nutrient use efficiency (NUE) from region to region, between crops and in different cropping systems. As a consequence, both local and crop specific solutions will be required for NUE improvement at local as well as at national and international levels. Strategies to improve NUE will involve improvements to germplasm and optimized agronomy adapted to climate and location. Essential to effective solutions will be an understanding of genetics (G), environment (E), and management (M) and their interactions (G x E x M). Implementing appropriate solutions will require agronomic management, attention to environmental factors and improved varieties, optimized for current and future climate scenarios. As NUE is a complex trait with many contributing processes, identifying the correct trait for improvement is not trivial. Key processes include nitrogen capture (uptake efficiency), utilization efficiency (closely related to yield), partitioning (harvest index: biochemical and organ-specific) and trade-offs between yield and quality aspects (grain nitrogen content), as well as interactions with capture and utilization of other nutrients. A long-term experiment, the Broadbalk experiment at Rothamsted, highlights many factors influencing yield and nitrogen utilization in wheat over the last 175 years, particularly management and yearly variation. A more recent series of trials conducted over the past 16 years has focused on separating the key physiological sub-traits of NUE, highlighting both genetic and seasonal variation. This perspective describes these two contrasting studies which indicate G x E x M interactions involved in nitrogen utilization and summarizes prospects for the future including the utilization of high throughput phenotyping technology.",

        "Comment": "Bacterial denitrification results in the loss of fertilizer nitrogen and greenhouse gas emissions as nitrous oxides, but ecological factors in soil influencing denitrifier communities are not well understood, impeding the potential for mitigation by land management. Communities vary in the relative abundance of the alternative dissimilatory nitrite reductase genes nirK and nirS, and the nitrous oxide reductase gene nosZ; however, the significance for nitrous oxide emissions is unclear. We assessed the influence of different long-term fertilization and cultivation treatments in a 160-year-old field experiment, comparing the potential for denitrification by soil samples with the size and diversity of their denitrifier communities. Denitrification potential was much higher in soil from an area left to develop from arable into woodland than from a farmyard manure-fertilized arable treatment, which in turn was significantly higher than inorganic nitrogen-fertilized and unfertilized arable plots. This correlated with abundance of nirK but not nirS, the least abundant of the genes tested in all soils, showing an inverse relationship with nirK. Most genetic variation was seen in nirK, where sequences resolved into separate groups according to soil treatment. We conclude that bacteria containing nirK are most probably responsible for the increased denitrification potential associated with nitrogen and organic carbon in this soil.",

        "Comment": "Bioenergy developments could lead to large-scale removal of cereal straw from fields, with consequences for soil organic carbon (SOC) and related properties. In 25 experiments of 6 to 56 yr duration there was a trend for SOC and total soil N content to increase where straw was incorporated annually. However the increases were only significant in six experiments and were <10% in the majority of cases. Increases in microbial biomass C or N were always proportionately greater than for SOC or N. In simulations of annual straw incorporation using the RothC model, 90% of the microbial biomass C increase in 100 yr was reached within 20 yr as biomass C moves toward a new equilibrium value more rapidly than total SOC. Simulations also showed that if straw was removed in 50% of years, SOC and biomass C increases were about 50% of those with annual straw incorporation. There is considerable evidence that small changes in total SOC have disproportionately large impacts on soil physical properties such as aggregate stability, water infiltration rate, and plow draft and that microbial activity is crucial in the formation of stable aggregates. We conclude that, although changes in SOC resulting from addition or removal of straw are small, it would be unwise to remove straw every year as this is likely to lead to deterioration in soil physical properties. Local assessments are required to determine the frequency of straw removal that is acceptable for soil functioning; this will influence the capacity of bioenergy installations.",

        "Comment": "Abstract Soil microbes drive decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) and regulate soil carbon (C) dynamics. Process-based models have been developed to quantify changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes in agricultural ecosystems. However, microbial processes related to SOM decomposition have not been, or are inadequately, represented in these models, limiting predictions of SOC responses to changes in microbial activities. In this study, we developed a microbial-mediated decomposition model based on a widely used biogeochemical model, DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC), to simulate C dynamics in agricultural ecosystems. The model simulates organic matter decomposition, soil respiration, and SOC formation by simulating microbial and enzyme dynamics and their controls on decomposition, and considering impacts of climate, soil, crop, and farming management practices (FMPs) on C dynamics. When evaluated against field observations of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and SOC change in two winter-wheat systems, the model successfully captured both NEE and SOC changes under different FMPs. Inclusion of microbial processes improved the model's performance in simulating peak CO2 fluxes induced by residue return, primarily by capturing priming effects of residue inputs. We also investigated impacts of microbial physiology, SOM, and FMPs on soil C dynamics. Our results demonstrated that residue or manure input drove microbial activity and predominantly regulated the CO2 fluxes, and manure amendment largely regulated long-term SOC change. The microbial physiology had considerable impacts on the microbial activities and soil C dynamics, emphasizing the necessity of considering microbial physiology and activities when assessing soil C dynamics in agricultural ecosystems.",

        "Comment": "Model-calculated forecasts of soil organic carbon (SOC) are important for approximating global terrestrial carbon pools and assessing their change. However, the lack of detailed observations limits the reliability and applicability of these SOC projections. Here, we studied whether state data assimilation (SDA) can be used to continuously update the modeled state with available total carbon measurements in order to improve future SOC estimations. We chose six fallow test sites with measurement time series spanning 30 to 80 years for this initial test. In all cases, SDA improved future projections but to varying degrees. Furthermore, already including the first few measurements impacted the state enough to reduce the error in decades-long projections by at least 1?t?C?ha?1. Our results show the benefits of implementing SDA methods for forecasting SOC as well as highlight implementation aspects that need consideration and further research.",

        "Comment": "The application of calcium- and magnesium-rich materials to soil, known as liming, has long been a foundation of many agro-ecosystems worldwide because of its role in counteracting soil acidity. Although liming contributes to increased rates of respiration from soil thereby potentially reducing soils ability to act as a CO2 sink, the long-term effects of liming on soil organic carbon (C-org) sequestration are largely unknown. Here, using data spanning 129 years of the Park Grass Experiment at Rothamsted (UK), we show net C-org sequestration measured in the 0-23 cm layer at different time intervals since 1876 was 2-20 times greater in limed than in unlimed soils. The main cause of this large C-org accrual was greater biological activity in limed soils, which despite increasing soil respiration rates, led to plant C inputs being processed and incorporated into resistant soil organo-mineral pools. Limed organo-mineral soils showed: (1) greater C-org content for similar plant productivity levels (i.e. hay yields); (2) higher 14C incorporation after 1950s atomic bomb testing and (3) lower C : N ratios than unlimed organo-mineral soils, which also indicate higher microbial processing of plant C. Our results show that greater C-org sequestration in limed soils strongly reduced the global warming potential of long-term liming to permanent grassland suggesting the net contribution of agricultural liming to global warming could be lower than previously estimated. Our study demonstrates that liming might prove to be an effective mitigation strategy, especially because liming applications can be associated with a reduced use of nitrogen fertilizer which is a key cause for increased greenhouse gas emissions from agro-ecosystems.",

        "Comment": "Soil organic matter (SOM) is an important component of soil fertility. Its positive effects are long considered and universally accepted. Fertilisation is one of the most important factors influencing organic matter content in soils. The paper reviews the aspects of mineral and organic fertilisation management related to SOM, using data from long-term field experiments. In the Broadbalk Winter Wheat Experiment at Rothamsted (Great Britain) with continuous applications of mineral fertilizers and farmyard manure (FYM), the content of SOM in FYM treated soils increased relative to that in mineral fertilizer treated soils. In the Market Garden Experiment, Woburn (Great Britain) four different types of organic manures have been applied. The content of soil organic carbon increased linearly with the increasing amount of organic matter added in manures. Results of the Continuous Rye Experiment in Halle (Germany) indicate an increase of soil organic matter through manure application and a very low increase through NPK application. Similar results are reported from the long-term fertilisation experiment in Martonvasar (Hungary). Manure application influenced strongly and mineral fertilization to a much smaller extent the content of soil organic matter. In the treatments without any fertilizer application, the content of SOM decreased. However, results of the long-term fertilisation experiment in Godollo showed an increase of soil organic matter content under the influence of mineral fertilisation. In another long term fertilisation experiment in Keszthely (Hungary) the highest SOM content has been found for manure application, independently of the level of mineral nitrogen fertilisation.",

        "Comment": "Recently rheological methods have been used to investigate the mechanical properties of soil micro-structure. Rheological techniques provide a number of quantitative physically based measurements and offer a better understanding of how soil micro-structure behaves when subject to stress. Here a rotational rheometer with a parallel-plate measuring device was used to explore the viscoelastic properties of soil as a function of soil organic carbon (SOC). We used samples from the long-term experimental site at Broadbalk, Rothamsted, UK. Data from amplitude sweep tests (AST) with controlled shear deformation are reported as well as mineralogical data. In general, water content, and SOC content, in addition to soil texture, clay mineralogy, carbonate, and cations all have an effect on stiffness, structural stability, and shear behavior. Storage modulus G? and loss modulus G, yield point, the linear viscoelastic range (LVE), loss factor tan delta, and integral z characterize micro-structural properties of soil on the particle-to-particle scale. Long-term applications of farmyard manure (FYM) lead to a significant increase in soil organic carbon (SOC), in comparison with the application of ammonium nitrate in form of mineral NPK fertilizer and bare fallow. For wet soils, increased SOC provided greater resistance to deformation and improved soil elastic properties allowing greater deformation before a yield point was reached. In drier soils however, (-6 and -15 kPa) this relationship was less clear.",

        "Comment": "Soil organic matter (SOM), which contains about 50% carbon  (C), influences virtually all soil properties. The management practices leading to increased soil organic carbon (SOC) content are generally well known and include the addition of manures or crop residues, organic inputs through cover crops where soil would otherwise be bare, and inclusion of periods of pasture within arable cropping systems. Changes in SOC in response to alterations in management practice occur slowly, so long-term experiments are valuable in detecting and quantifying them. New research approaches include the use of non-destructive imaging techniques that provide information on pore space within the soil matrix and the connectivity of pores. Inputs of organic matter are pocessed by soil microbes and the metabolites form associations with mineral particles. These processes at the small-scale lead to structural reorganisation at larger scales which, in turn facilitate changes in oxygen diffusion into soil and the microbial processing of organic C and nutrients. Imaging of pore networks clearly shows how a clay loam soil adapts to differences in organic inputs, but a sandy loam does not adapt in a similar manner. Thus the physical structure and resulting changes in biological activity, are less influenced by organic inputs in sandy textured soils. This is consistent with the observation that sandy soils have much less capacity to sequester carbon than soils of finer texture. The results also indicate that, in responding to organic inputs, soil can be regarded as a self-organising system. There is much interest in sequestering carbon in soil as a means of mitigating climate change. But, from the viewpoint of soil functioning, we argue that it is the flow of carbon through soil that is key, rather than actual stock at a given time. We thus propose a dynamic rather than static view of soil. There is currently considerable interest in making payments to farmers in return for carbon sequestered. We consider that there are formidable challenges to doing this in an equitable manner in practical farming situations. This is in large part because of the difficulty of measuring the likely small changes in SOC within a short time period; but there are also issues relating to the potential for C sequestration being strongly influenced by soil type and the starting SOC content, which will be a legacy of past practices. There are various measurements, including soil microbial biomass and a range of technically defined so-called \u2018active\u2019 fractions of SOM that are useful in showing whether SOC is increasing or decreasing in response to a change of management. However, these measurements provide neither an estimate of SOC stocks nor a prediction of absolute changes in SOC. If a system of policy requirements or financial incentives for increasing SOC is to be instituted, we propose an alternative approach using SOC models to predict probable SOC changes taking account of soil type, climate, cropping practices and initial SOC content. This could be combined with closer monitoring at a network of benchmark sites. Interactions between findings at these sites, observations within farmers\u2019 fields, and modelled SOC changes would provide a sound basis for improved understanding of the underlying processes and modification of management practices in a range of situations.",

        "Comment": "1. Culicoides biting midges are vectors of internationally important arboviruses including bluetongue virus (BTV). The ecological constraints imposed by the small body size of these insects strongly influence the epidemiology of the diseases they can carry. Bluetongue virus recently emerged in northern Europe, and atmospheric dispersion models have subsequently been employed to simulate vector movement (and hence likely spread of BTV). The data underlying such models, however, have hitherto either been obtained from small-scale studies or from outside the northwestern Palaearctic. 2. The effects of seasonality and local meteorological conditions upon the daily presence and abundance of Culicoides vectors were examined using 2760 samples collected across a network of 12 different habitat types in England during 2008. Over 50 000 individuals were estimated to be in the samples with males constituting 62% of the total collection, allowing straightforward comparison between potential vector species in terms of their activity rates and seasonality. Culicoides abundance was linked to livestock density and land use. Farm-associated Culicoides species were recorded at all sites including species thought to be restricted to this ecosystem by larval habitat, suggesting a greater potential for dispersal over land than previously thought. 3. Synthesis and applications. The model developed has already been applied in a functional dispersion model to predict disease risk from wind-borne infected Culicoides incursion into the UK and elsewhere. The study has expounded the long-distance dispersal potential of Culicoides, essential for future prediction of the incursion and spread of Culicoides-borne pathogens. It has additionally contributed to the understanding of the ecology of highly dispersive insect vectors.",

        "Comment": "Denitrification in autumn removes nitrate from soil which may limit subsequent crop growth but also lessens the nitrate available for leaching. Autumn denitrification may therefore play a significant role in determining water quality because autumn and winter leaching of nitrate probably provides the greater part of the nitrate reaching groundwater from arable agriculture. The influence of soil carbon content on rates of denitrification during October and November 1987 was investigated in field plots of a continuous spring barley experiment which had large differences in soil organic matter content. Denitrification occurred between early autumn, when the warm soil became saturated with water, and late autumn when its temperature dropped to 6?8\u00b0C. Gaseous N losses from plots with a low carbon content and given inorganic nitrogen were equivalent to 4.5 kg N ha?1, but those from farmyard?manure?treated plots with a high carbon content were 29 kg N ha?1, approximately six times greater. Measurements indicated that the high carbon content plots contained twice the denitrifying biomass of the low carbon content plots. The initial denitrification rate (Phase 1) of a laboratory measurement of potential denitrification gave a good estimate of denitrification in the field.",

        "Comment": "N-15-labelled fertilizer was applied, in spring, to winter wheat crops in nine experiments in eastern England over a period of 4 years. Five were on Batcombe Series silty clay loam, two on Beccles Series sandy clay loam (with a mole-drained clay subsoil) and two on Cottenham Series sandy loam. In three of the experiments, different rates of fertilizer N were applied (up to 234 kg N/ha); in the others, a single rate (between 140 and 230 kg/ha) was used. Recovery of fertilizer N in the above-ground crop (grain, chaff, straw and stubble) ranged from 46 to 87% (mean 68%). The quantity of fertilizer N retained in the soil at harvest was remarkably constant between different experiments, averaging 18% where labelled N was applied as (NH4NO3)-N-15-N-15, but less (7-14%) where (KNO3)-N-15 was applied. Of the labelled N present in soil to a depth of 70 cm, 84-88% was within the cultivated layer (0-23 cm). Loss of fertilizer N from the crop: soil system (i.e. labelled N not recovered in crop or soil at harvest) varied from 1 to 35% (mean 13%). The magnitude of loss was influenced much more by weather than by soil type or past cropping. Combining data from these and earlier experiments, the regression L70 = 5(+/- 1.63) + 0.264(+/- 0.0352) R3 accounted for 73% of the variation in the data where: L70 = percentage loss of fertilizer N from the crop: soil system, defined as percentage of labelled N not recovered in crop or in soil to a depth of 70 cm at the time of harvest; R3 = rainfall (in mm) in the 3 weeks following application of N fertilizer. There was a tendency for percentage loss of fertilizer N to be greater when a quantity of N in excess of that required for maximum grain yield was applied. However, a multiple regression relating loss both to rainfall and to quantity of N applied accounted for no more variance than the regression involving rainfall alone. In one experiment, early and late sowing were compared on the first wheat crop that followed oats. The loss of N from the early-sown crop, given fertilizer N late in spring, was only 4% compared with 26% from the later-sown crop given N at the same time, so that sowing date had a marked effect on the loss of spring-applied fertilizer N. Uptake of unlabelled N, derived from mineralization of organic N in soil, autumn-applied N (where given) and from atmospheric inputs, was < 30 kg/ha on a low organic matter (0.08% total N) sandy soil but > 130 kg/ha when wheat followed potatoes or beans on soil containing c. 0.15% total N. Unlabelled N accounted for 20-50% of the total N content of fertilized crops at harvest. About 50% of this unlabelled N had already been taken up by the time of fertilizer application in spring and the final quantity was closely correlated with the amount present in the crop at this time. Applications of labelled fertilizer N tended to increase uptake of unlabelled N by 10-20 kg/ha, compared to controls receiving no N fertilizer. This was probably due to pool substitution, i.e. labelled inorganic N standing proxy for unlabelled inorganic N that would otherwise have been immobilized or denitrified.",

        "Comment": "Interactions between sulfur (S) nutritional status and sulfate transporter expression in field-grown wheat (Triticum aestivum) were investigated using Broadbalk +S and -S treatments (S fertilizer withheld) at Rothamsted, United Kingdom. In 2008, S, sulfate, selenium (Se), and molybdenum (Mo) concentrations and sulfate transporter gene expression were analyzed throughout development. Total S concentrations were lower in all tissues of -S plants, principally as a result of decreased sulfate pools. S, Se, and Mo concentrations increased in vegetative tissues until anthesis, and thereafter, with the exception of Mo, decreased until maturity. At maturity, most of the S and Se were localized in the grain, indicating efficient remobilization from vegetative tissues, whereas less Mo was remobilized. At maturity, Se and Mo were enhanced 7- and 3.7-fold, respectively, in -S compared with +S grain, while grain total S was not significantly reduced. Enhanced expression of sulfate transporters, for example Sultr1;1 and Sultr4;1, in -S plants explains the much increased accumulation of Se and Mo (7- and 3.7-fold compared with +S in grain, respectively). Sultr5;2 (mot1), thought to be involved in Mo accumulation in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), did not fully explain patterns of Mo distribution;it was expressed in all tissues, decreasing in leaf and increasing in roots under -S conditions, and was expressed in florets at anthesis but not in grain at any other time. In conclusion, S fertilizer application has a marked impact on Mo and Se distribution and accumulation, which is at least partially a result of altered gene expression of the sulfate transporter family.",

        "Comment": "In a long-term study of the effects on soil fertility and microbial activity of heavy metals contained in sewage sludges, metal-rich sludge cakes each with high Zn, Cu or Cd concentrations were applied annually for 4 years (1994-1997) to nine sites throughout Britain. These sites were selected to represent agricultural soils with a range of physical and chemical properties, typical of those likely to be amended with sewage sludge. The aim was to establish individual total Zn (approx. 60-450 mg kg(-1)), total Cu (approx. 15-200 mg kg(-1)) and total Cd (approx. 0.2-4 mg kg(-1)) metal dose-response treatments at each site. Sludges with low metal concentrations were added to all treatments to achieve as constant an addition of organic matter Lis possible. Across the nine sites, soil pH was the single most important factor controlling Zn (P < 0.001; r(2) = 92%) and Cd extracted with 1 m NH4NO3 (p < 0.001; r(2) = 72%), and total iron content the most important factor controlling Cu extracted with 1 m NH4NO3 (P < 0.001; r(2) = 64%). There were also positive relationships (P < 0.001) between soil organic carbon (C) concentrations and soil biomass C and respiration rates across the nine sites. Oxidation of sludge C following land application resulted in approximately 45% of the digested sludge cake C and approximately 64% of the 'raw' sludge cake C being lost by the end of the 4-year application period. The sludge cake applications generally increased soil microbial biomass C and soil respiration rates, whilst most probable numbers of clover Rhizobium were generally unchanged. Overall, there was no evidence that the metal applications were damaging soil microbial activity in the short term after the cessation of sludge cake addition.",

        "Comment": "In a long-term study of the effects on soil fertility and microbial activity of heavy metals contained in sewage sludges, metal-amended liquid sludges each with elevated Zn, Cu or Cd concentrations were applied over a 3-year period (1995\u20131997) to three sites in England. The experiments were sited adjacent to experimental plots receiving metal-rich sludge cakes enabling comparisons to be made between the effects of heavy metal additions in metal-amended liquid sludges and sludge cakes. The liquid sludge additions were regarded as \u2018worst case\u2019 treatments in terms of likely metal availability, akin to a longterm situation following sewage sludge additions where organic matter levels had declined and stabilised. The aim was to establish individual Zn (50\u2013425 mg kg)1), Cu (15\u2013195 mg kg)1) and Cd (0.3\u20134.0 mg kg)1) metal dose\u2013response treatments at each site, but with significantly smaller levels of organic matter addition than the corresponding sludge cake experiments. There were no differences (P > 0.05) in soil respiration rates, biomass carbon concentrations or most probable numbers of clover Rhizobium between the treatments at any of the sites at the end of the liquid sludge application programme. Soil heavy metal extractability differed between the metal-amended liquid sludge and metal-rich sludge cake treatments; Zn and Cd extractabilities were higher from the liquid sludge additions, whereas Cu extractability was higher from the sludge cake application. These differences in metal extractability in the treated soil samples reflected the contrasting NH4NO3 extractable metal contents of the metal-amended liquid sludges and sludge cakes that were originally applied.

        "Comment": "The effects on legumes of the long-term land application of sewage sludge are not clear. Sludge-borne toxic elements, as well as essential nutrients and organic matter, complicate the response of legumes in association with their symbionts. To examine this problem, several strains and species of Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium were studied for their response to the presence of heavy metals in agar growth media. Bradyrhizobiwn japonicum was by far the most metal-tolerant of the organisms examined, often able to tolerate several times more Zn and Cd in agar media than more metal-sensitive organisms, such as Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii. Soils were subsequently collected from metal-contaminated plots located at the Woburn Market Garden Experiment, and rhizobia were inoculated into these soils and sown with the appropriate homologous legume. Uninoculated controls and unamended soils were also sown. White clover (Trifolium repens) in the uninoculated, sludge-amended treatment contained numerous, small white and ineffective nodules. Inoculation enhanced nodulation and plant growth, but not to levels observed for plants grown on soil not amended with sludge. Inoculation with effective strains of rhizobia had little effect on plants grown in control soils since an indigenous, effective population compatible with white clover was present in adequate numbers. Only soybeans (Glycine max) responded to inoculation since soybeans had never been cultivated in these soils. These results confirm earlier observations that R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii in soils exposed to sludge-borne metals for many years are ineffective. Microbial species, chemical characteristics of the soil into which the sludge was added and the length of time the microbes were exposed to the metals each affected the response of the macro- and microsymbionts.",

        "Comment": "The effects of fertilizer regime on bulk soil microbial communities have been well studied, but this is not the case for the rhizosphere microbiome. The aim of this work was to assess the impact of fertilization regime on wheat rhizosphere microbiome assembly and 16S rRNA gene-predicted functions with soil from the long term Broadbalk experiment at Rothamsted Research. Soil from four N fertilization regimes (organic N, zero N, medium inorganic N and high inorganic N) was sown with seeds of Triticum aestivum cv. Cadenza. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was performed with the Illumina platform on bulk soil and rhizosphere samples of 4-week-old and flowering plants (10 weeks). Phylogenetic and 16S rRNA gene-predicted functional analyses were performed. Fertilization regime affected the structure and composition of wheat rhizosphere bacterial communities. Acidobacteria and Planctomycetes were significantly depleted in treatments receiving inorganic N, whereas the addition of high levels of inorganic N enriched members of the phylum Bacteroidetes, especially after 10 weeks. Bacterial richness and diversity decreased with inorganic nitrogen inputs and was highest after organic treatment (FYM). In general, high levels of inorganic nitrogen fertilizers negatively affect bacterial richness and diversity, leading to a less stable bacterial community structure over time, whereas, more stable bacterial communities are provided by organic amendments. 16S rRNA gene-predicted functional structure was more affected by growth stage than by fertilizer treatment, although, some functions related to energy metabolism and metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides were enriched in samples not receiving any inorganic N, whereas inorganic N addition enriched predicted functions related to metabolism of other amino acids and carbohydrates. Understanding the impact of different fertilizers on the structure and dynamics of the rhizosphere microbiome is an important step toward developing strategies for production of crops in a sustainable way.",

        "Comment": "Significant disparities exist between phosphorus (P) fertilizer applications and plant P uptake, in part induced by the in-soil conversion of inorganic P (Pi) to organic P forms (Po), which are not readily plant available. In-soil trophic interactions have been implicated in increased plant access to Po, specifically interactions between bacteria and bacterivorous nematodes. However, the existing data remains inconclusive and lack detail in arable systems, which are of increased economic importance. This work aimed to (1) assess the impact of nematodes as an additional trophic-level on Po use by plants in arable systems and (2) further understand the mechanisms of in-soil trophic interactions in improving plant acquisition of Po. To address these aims, criteria based meta-analysis, glasshouse plant growth trials, in vitro and in soil, and long term experimental (LTE) platforms were used. Results supported the conclusion that nematodes did not improve plant acquisition of Po per se. Time, soil P concentration and soil biological community composition had significant impacts on plant response. Although these factors were identified in two contrasting studies, their impacts on plant responses were stochastic. However, complexity, which describes the average number of trophic links per species, proved to be useful when understanding these data. For example, data from the meta-analysis and the plant growth trials demonstrated it was not simply the additive effect of the number of species or the addition of a specific species which resulted in predictable plant P responses. Both studies employed complexity as a system descriptor, which framed an understanding of these data where they evaded predictability, specifically when considering the temporal nature of these relationships, as complexity inherently includes a temporal element. The LTEs provided empirical data to support such assertions and yielded characteristics indicative of stability in the biotic component of systems previously considered disturbed. This exposed the question of the nature of disturbance (whether natural or anthropogenic). Additionally, it highlighted the importance of which successional time-point was being studied and the impact this has on the data captured. For example, nematode community analysis in the arable site assumed to represent disturbed land, showed characteristics of an undisturbed system, therefore it is not enough to assume an arable system is \u2018disturbed\u2019 or that an arable system after 150 years of continuous treatment would replicate results from a site under continuous management of a different temporal scale. Results allowed for the assessment of the experimental approaches used to interrogate complex systems and suggestions are made for a more pragmatic approach for the future. Although simple experimental systems exploring discrete mechanisms should not be abandoned, extrapolation of such data and predictions to more complex systems must involve the abandonment of the linear reductionist model and undergo transformative inclusion into one of complexity.

        "Comment": "Pastures provide a good model system to study intergenotypic plant interactions because most pastures are mixtures of several sown genotypes and species and the conditions necessary for genetic change are present: (i) an extremely variable biotic and abiotic environment at the local scale, (ii) wide genetic variation, (iii) intense competition so that strong selection is likely, and (iv) long term continuity enables selection to be continuous and cumulative. These together provide a system in which (v) the theoretical outcome of intergenotypic interactions may be readily tested and maximizes the probability of detecting patterns. Interactions between the species will have both ecological and evolutionary consequences, both of which may be of interest to plant breeders. These patterns are detectable at different scales but particular attention will be focused at the level of the individual genotype and especially with mixtures of the grass Lolium perenne and the legume Trifolium repens. Competition experiments between L. perenne and T. repens are plentiful, but where specific hypotheses about adaptation at the genotype level have been tested, in all cases T. repens grows best when planted with its natural L. perenne neighbor - a reciprocal effect in the L. perenne has only been reported once. This specific T. repens - L. perenne neighbor recognition may be mediated through soil microorganisms, particularly Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar trifolii and Bacillus polymyxa.",

        "Comment": "A 150-year-long record of intrinsic water-use efficiency (W-i) was derived from community-level carbon isotope discrimination (13 delta) in the herbage of the unfertilized, unlimed control treatment (plot 3) of the Park Grass Experiment at Rothamsted (England) between 1857 and 2007. 13 delta during spring growth (first cut harvested in June) averaged 21.0 parts per thousand (+/- 0.5 parts per thousand SD) and has not shown a long-term trend (P=0.5) since 1857. 13 delta of summer/autumn growth (second cut harvested between September and November) increased from 21.3 parts per thousand to 22.0 parts per thousand (P < 0.001) between 1875 and 2007. W-i during spring growth has therefore increased by 33% since the beginning of the experiment, and W-i of summer/autumn growth has increased by 18%. The variation in 13 delta was mainly related to weather conditions. Plant available soil water explained 51% and 40% of the variation in spring growth 13 delta and summer/autumn growth 13 delta, respectively. In the 1857-2007 period yields have not increased, suggesting that community-level photosynthesis has not increased either. Therefore, the increased W-i probably resulted from a decreased stomatal conductance. Vapour pressure deficit (VPD) during spring growth (March-June) has not changed since 1915, meaning that instantaneous water-use efficiency (W-t) in spring time has increased and transpiration has probably decreased, provided that leaf temperature followed air temperature. Conversely, VPD in the months between the first and second cut has increased by 0.07 kPa since 1915, offsetting the effect of increased W-i on W-t during summer and early autumn. Our results suggest that vegetation has adjusted physiologically to elevated CO2 by decreasing stomatal conductance in this nutrient-limited grassland.",

        "Comment": "The question as to why some plant communities are more invasible than others has profound implications for conservation biology and land management. The theoretical issues involved are central to the understanding of species coexistence and community assembly. In an experiment at Silwood Park, Ascot, UK, four perennial grasses (Arrhenatherum elatius, Alopecurus pratensis, Festuca rubra and Anthoxanthum odoratum) were grown singly, in 2-species mixtures or a 4-species mixture or 80 species of British native dicotyledonous forbs were sown in small plots and given 0, 5 or 20 t lime/ha. The species and lime treatments were selected because they matched parts of the Park Grass Experiment at Rothamsted, Herts, UK. In all plots the seed bank and any remaining vegetation was killed by fumigation with methyl bromide prior to the start of the experiment. All plots received 150 kg N, 35 kg P and 225 kg K applied annually in April. The plots were weeded at 2-weekly intervals from germination in September 1991 until the end of the rapid growth phase in June 1992. Any gaps were resown when necessary. Three legumes (Trifolium repens, Trifolium dubium and Lotus corniculatus) survived the methyl bromide treatment in low numbers. From July 1992 onwards when the plots were reasonably established, unsown species were allowed to invade. A. odoratum and F. rubra were the least persistent species. Over 7 years, the number of species in the pure stands increased. In the mixed plots, A. pratensis was most competitive, followed by A. elatius. In the mixed forbs, annuals were rapidly replaced by perennials. The most successful invaders were Holcus lanatus, Anisantha sterilis [Bromus sterilis], Agrostis capillaris, Poa trivialis, B. hordeaceus, Stellaria media and Cirsium arvense. The probability of invasion by a given species was generally not related to the species composition of the plot. There was no correlation between the number of species sown in 1981 and the number of unsown species in 1998. There was a highly significant relationship between the presence of A. pratensis and the number of other species, whether A. pratensis was sown or an unsown invader. (Plots with A. pratensis generally contained fewer species than plots without A. pratensis). This experiment indicated that for productive, small-scale grassland plots, species identity was more important than species richness in determining both the number of invading species and the total biomass of invasives.",

The extent to which inter-annual variation in the parameters of these responses was explained by variations in weather (monthly summarized temperatures and rainfall), and by changes in the cultivar grown, was assessed. The inter-annual variability in rainfall and underlying temperature influenced the crop N response and hence grain yields in both crops. Asymptotic yields in wheat were particularly sensitive to mean temperature in November, April and May, and to total rainfall in October, February and June. In spring barley asymptotic yields were sensitive to mean temperature in February and June, and to total rainfall in April to July inclusive and September. The method presented here explores the separation of agronomic and environmental (weather) influences on crop yield over time. Fitting N response curves across multiple treatments can support an informative analysis of the influence of weather variation on the yield variability. Whilst there are issues of the confounding and collinearity of explanatory variables within such models, and that other factors also influence yields over time, our study confirms the considerable impact of weather variables at certain times of the year. This emphasizes the importance of including weather temporal variation when evaluating the impacts of climate change on crops.",

        "Comment": "Clearing natural vegetation to establish arable agriculture (cropland) almost invariably causes a loss of soil organic carbon (SOC). Is it possible to restore soil that continues in arable agriculture to the pre-clearance SOC level through modified management practices? To address this question we reviewed evidence from long-term experiments at Rothamsted Research, UK, Bad Lauchst\u00e4dt, Germany, Sanborn Field, USA and Brazil and both experiments and surveys of farmers\u2019 fields in Ethiopia, Australia, Zimbabwe, UK and Chile. In most cases SOC content in soil under arable cropping was in the range 38\u201367% of pre-clearance values. Returning crop residues, adding manures or including periods of pasture within arable rotations increased this, often to 60\u201370% of initial values. Under tropical climatic conditions SOC loss after clearance was particularly rapid, e.g. a loss of >50% in less than 10 years in smallholder farmers\u2019 fields in Zimbabwe. If larger yielding crops were grown, using fertilizers, and maize stover returned instead of being grazed by cattle, the loss was reduced. An important exception to the general trend of SOC loss after clearance was clearing Cerrado vegetation on highly weathered acidic soils in Brazil and conversion to cropping with maize and soybean. Other exceptions were unrealistically large annual applications of manure and including long periods of pasture in a highly SOC-retentive volcanic soil. Also, introducing irrigated agriculture in a low rainfall region can increase SOC beyond the natural value due to increased plant biomass production. For reasons of sustainability and soil health it is important to maintain SOC as high as practically possible in arable soils, but we conclude that in the vast majority of situations it is unrealistic to expect to maintain pre-clearance values. To maintain global SOC stocks at we consider it is more important to reduce current rates of land clearance and sustainably produce necessary food on existing agricultural land.",

        "Comment": "Until recently, agricultural production was optimised almost exclusively for profit but now farming is under pressure to meet environmental targets. A method is presented and applied for optimising the sustainability of agricultural production systems in terms of both economics and the environment. Components of the agricultural production chain are analysed using environmental life-cycle assessment (LCA) and a financial value attributed to the resources consumed and burden imposed on the environment by agriculture, as well as to the products. The sum of the outputs is weighed against the inputs and the system considered sustainable if the value of the outputs exceeds those of the inputs. If this ratio is plotted against the sum of inputs for all levels of input, a diminishing returns curve should result and the optimum level of sustainability is located at the maximum of the curve. Data were taken from standard economic almanacs and from published LCA reports on the extent of consumption and environmental burdens resulting from farming in the UK. Land-use is valued using the concept of ecosystem services. Our analysis suggests that agricultural systems are sustainable at rates of production close to current levels practiced in the UK. Extensification of farming, which is thought to favour non-food ecosystem services, requires more land to produce the same amount of food. The loss of ecosystem services hitherto provided by natural land brought into production is greater than that which can be provided by land now under extensive farming. This loss of ecosystem service is large in comparison to the benefit of a reduction in emission of nutrients and pesticides. However, food production is essential, so the coupling of subsidies that represent a relatively large component of the economic output in EU farming, with measures to reduce pollution are well-aimed. Measures to ensure that as little extra land is brought into production as possible or that marginal land is allowed to revert to nature would seem to be equally well-aimed, even if this required more intensive use of productive areas. We conclude that current arable farming in the EU is sustainable with either realistic prices for products or some degree of subsidy and that productivity per unit area of land and greenhouse gas emission (subsuming primary energy consumption) are the most important pressures on the sustainability of farming.",

We developed in empirical yield model for Miscanthus from harvestable dry matter yields at 14 field trials in the UK to estimate site-specific and regional yields derived front meteorological variables and soil available Water. Harvestable yields of crops established for at least 3 years at 14 arable sites across the UK ranged from 5 to 18 t/ha, averaging at 12.8 (+/- 2.9) t/ha. Variables considered to affect yield were number of years after plantings length of season (T-air > 9 degrees C), temperature. global solar radiation, precipitation and potential evapotranspiration during the season, and soil available water capacity (AWC). At a single site (Rothamsted), AWC and the relative average potential soil moisture deficit during the main growing season explained 70% of annual yield variation (RMSE = 1.38 t/ha, P < 0.001). F or the complete UK data set (n = 67) yield variation was related to A WC, air temperature and precipitation (RMSE = 2.1 t/ha, P < 0.01). Linking soil Survey and spatially interpolated weather data we calculated an overall national average dry matter yield of 9.6 t/ha. As shown for two counties (Oxfordshire and North Yorkshire), estimated yield may decrease by 1 t/ha, and its uncertainty may rise from 15 to > 20%, when soil survey instead of local soil data are used. Using data from a single weather station can introduce a bias (< I t/ha) because of differences in elevation and local temperature and precipitation. Overall. it seems most important for bioenergy plantings to assure Sufficient Water supply from the soil (AWC > 150 mm) during the main growing season.",

        "Comment": "Soil pH influences the chemistry, dynamics and biological availability of phosphorus (P), but few studies have isolated the effect of pH from other soil properties. We studied phosphorus chemistry in soils along the Hoosfield acid strip (Rothamsted, UK), where a pH gradient from 3.7 to 7.8 occurs in a single soil with little variation in total phosphorus (mean +/- standard deviation 399 +/- 27mgPkg1). Soil organic phosphorus represented a consistent proportion of the total soil phosphorus (36 +/- 2%) irrespective of soil pH. However, organic phosphorus concentrations increased by about 20% in the most acidic soils (pH<4.0), through an accumulation of inositol hexakisphosphate, DNA and phosphonates. The increase in organic phosphorus in the most acidic soils was not related to organic carbon, because organic carbon concentrations declined at pH <4.0. Thus, the organic carbon to organic phosphorus ratio declined from about 70 in neutral soils to about 50 in strongly acidic soils. In contrast to organic phosphorus, inorganic phosphorus was affected strongly by soil pH, because readily-exchangeable phosphate extracted with anion-exchange membranes and a more stable inorganic phosphorus pool extracted in NaOHEDTA both increased markedly as soil pH declined. Inorganic orthophosphate concentrations were correlated negatively with amorphous manganese and positively with amorphous aluminium oxides, suggesting that soil pH influences orthophosphate stabilization via metal oxides. We conclude that pH has a relatively minor influence on the amount of organic phosphorus in soil, although some forms of organic phosphorus accumulate preferentially under strongly acidic conditions.",

        "Comment": "The geo-statistical Kriging method is conventionally used in the spatial dimension to predict missing values in a series by utilizing information from neighbouring data, supported by the hypothesis that mathematical expectation is a function of distance between observations. By using a data-driven machine learning-based in-ferencing and exploration framework, this research applies a Kriging-based interpolation in the temporal dimension to fill in data gaps in time-series of air temperatures. It assesses its performance for artificial gap scenarios (ranging in length from single one to six consecutive data points) generated using data with both daily and hourly resolutions from five sites in Europe (Laqueuille, France; Grillenburg, Germany; Monte Bondone, Italy; Oensingen, Switzerland; Rothamsted, United Kingdom) and one in France overseas (Sedael, Reunion Island). Results show that the method is capable of predicting missing temperatures with acceptable accuracy, especially with the hourly resolution and for non-high elevation sites: modeling efficiency (EF <= 1, optimum) >0.8, with the exception of Monte Bondone, placed at > 2000 m a.s.l. (EF < 0). With daily data, maximum temperature was correctly predicted at all sites (0.6 <= EF < 0.9), while some less accuracy (down to EF < 0.4) was noted when predicting missing daily minimum temperatures. In conclusion, the method appears suitable to be applied to fill in hourly temperature gaps, requiring more stringent hypotheses concerning daily data and mountain sites (but further studies are required to draw concluding recommendations).",

        "Comment": "Population genetic theory predicts that the availability of appropriate standing genetic variation should facilitate rapid evolution when species are introduced to new environments. However, few tests of rapid evolution have been paired with empirical surveys for the presence of previously identified adaptive genetic variants in natural populations. In this study, we examined local adaptation to soil Al toxicity in the introduced range of sweet vernal grass (<i>Anthoxanthum odoratum</i>), and we genotyped populations for the presence of Al tolerance alleles previously identified at the long-term ecological Park Grass Experiment (PGE, Harpenden, UK) in the species native range. We found that markers associated with Al tolerance at the PGE were present at appreciable frequency in introduced populations. Despite this, there was no strong evidence of local adaptation to soil Al toxicity among populations. Populations demonstrated significantly different intrinsic root growth rates in the absence of Al. This suggests that selection on correlated root growth traits may constrain the ability of populations to evolve significantly different root growth responses to Al. Our results demonstrate that genotype-phenotype associations may differ substantially between the native and introduced parts of a species range and that adaptive alleles from a native species range may not necessarily promote phenotypic differentiation in the introduced range.",

        "Comment": "Microbial community ecology studies have traditionally utilized culture-based methodologies, though the advent of next-generation amplicon sequencing has facilitated superior resolution analyses of complex microbial communities. Here, we used culture-dependent and -independent approaches to explore the influence of land use as well as microbial seed load on bacterial community structure of the wheat rhizosphere and root endosphere. It was found that niche was an important factor in shaping the microbiome when using both methodological approaches, and that land use was also a discriminatory factor for the culture-independent-based method. Although culture-independent methods provide a higher resolution of analysis, it was found that in the rhizosphere, particular operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the culture-dependent fraction were absent from the culture-independent fraction, indicating that deeper sequence analysis is required for this approach to be exhaustive. We also found that the microbial seed load defined the endosphere, but not rhizosphere, community structure for plants grown in soil which was not wheat adapted. Together, these findings increase our understanding of the importance of land management and microbial seed load in shaping the root microbiome of wheat and this knowledge will facilitate the exploitation of plant\u2013microbe interactions for the development of novel microbial inoculants.",

        "Comment": "Summary Phosphorus cycling exerts significant influence upon soil fertility and productivity \u2013 processes largely controlled by microbial activity. We adopted phenotypic and metagenomic approaches to investigate phosphatase genes within soils. Microbial communities in bare fallowed soil showed a marked capacity to utilise phytate for growth compared with arable or grassland soil communities. Bare fallowed soil contained lowest concentrations of orthophosphate. Analysis of metagenomes indicated phoA, phoD and phoX, and histidine acid and cysteine phytase genes were most abundant in grassland soil which contained the greatest amount of NaOH-EDTA extractable orthophosphate. Beta-propeller phytase genes were most abundant in bare fallowed soil. Phylogenetic analysis of metagenome sequences indicated the phenotypic shift observed in the capacity to mineralise phytate in bare fallow soil was accompanied by an increase in phoD, phoX and beta-propeller phytase genes coding for exoenzymes. However, there was a remarkable degree of genetic similarity across the soils despite the differences in land-use. Predicted extracellular ecotypes were distributed across a greater range of soil structure than predicted intracellular ecotypes, suggesting that microbial communities subject to the dual stresses of low nutrient availability and reduced access to organic material in bare fallowed soils rely upon the action of exoenzymes.",

        "Comment": "Carabid beetles are important functional components of many terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we describe the first long-term, wide-scale and quantitative assessment of temporal changes in UK carabid communities, to inform nationwide management aimed at their conservation. Multivariate and mixed models were used to assess temporal trends over a 15-year period, across eleven sites in the UK Environmental Change Network. Sites covered pasture, field margins, chalk downland, woodland and hedgerows in the lowlands, moorland and pasture in the uplands, and grassland, heaths and bogs in montane locations. We found substantial overall declines in carabid biodiversity. Three-quarters of the species studied declined, half of which were estimated to be undergoing population reductions of > 30%, when averaged over 10-year periods. Declines of this magnitude are recognized to be of conservation concern. They are comparable to those reported for butterflies and moths and increase the evidence base showing that insects are undergoing serious and widespread biodiversity losses. Overall trends masked differences between regions and habitats. Carabid population declines (10-year trend, averaged across species) were estimated to be 52% in montane sites, 31% in northern moorland sites and 28% in western pasture sites (with at least 80% of species declining in each case). Conversely, populations in our southern downland site had 10-year increases of 48% on average. Overall, biodiversity was maintained in upland pasture, and populations were mostly stable in woodland and hedgerow sites. Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight the need to assess trends for carabids, and probably other widespread and ubiquitous taxa, across regions and habitats to fully understand losses in biodiversity. Land management should be underpinned by a consideration of how wide-scale environmental drivers interact with habitat structure. The stability of population trends in woodlands and hedgerows of species that are declining elsewhere puts these habitats at the fore-front of integrated landscape management aimed at preserving their ecosystem services.",

        "Comment": "Last-century climate change has led to variable increases of the intrinsic water-use efficiency (Wi; the ratio of net CO2 assimilation to stomatal conductance for water vapor) of trees and C3 grassland ecosystems, but the causes of the variability are not well understood. Here, we address putative drivers underlying variable Wi responses in a wide range of grassland communities. Wi was estimated from carbon isotope discrimination in archived herbage samples from 16 contrasting fertilizer treatments in the Park Grass Experiment, Rothamsted, England, for the 1915 to 1929 and 1995 to 2009 periods. Changes in Wi were analyzed in relation to nitrogen input, soil pH, species richness, and functional group composition. Treatments included liming as well as phosphorus and potassium additions with or without ammonium or nitrate fertilizer applications at three levels. Wi increased between 11% and 25% (P<0.001) in the different treatments between the two periods. None of the fertilizers had a direct effect on the change of Wi (DWi). However, soil pH (P<0.05), species richness (P< 0.01), and percentage grass content (P<0.01) were significantly related to DWi. Grass-dominated, species-poor plots on acidic soils showed the largest DWi (+14.7 <i>\u00b5</i>mol -1). The DWi response of these acidic plots was probably related to drought effects resulting from aluminum toxicity on root growth. Our results from the Park Grass Experiment show that Wi in grassland communities consistently increased over a wide range of nutrient inputs, soil pH, and plant community compositions during the last century.",

        "Comment": "Liming has widespread and significant impacts on soil processes and crop responses. The aim of this study was to describe the relationships between exchangeable cation concentrations in soil and the relative yield of spring barley. The hypothesis was that yield is restricted by the concentration of a single exchangeable cation in the soil. For simplicity, we focused on spring barley which was grown in nine years of a long-term experiment at two sites (Rothamsted and Woburn). Four liming rates were applied and in each year the relative yield (RY) and the concentrations of exchangeable cations were assessed. Liming had highly significant effects on the concentrations of most exchangeable cations, except for Cu and K. There were significant negative relationships (either linear or exponential) between the exchangeable concentrations of Mn, Cd, Cr, Al, Fe, Cu, Co, Zn and Ni in soil and soil pH. The relationships between RY and the concentrations of selected exchangeable cations (Mn, Ca and Al) were described well using log-logistic relationships. For these cations a significant site effect was probably due to fundamental differences in soil properties. At both sites the concentrations of exchangeable soil Al were excessive (>?7.5\u00a0mg\u00a0kg?1) and were most likely responsible for reduced barley yields (where RY???0.5) with soil acidification. At Rothamsted barley yield was non-limited (where RY???1) at soil exchangeable Mn concentrations (up to 417\u00a0mg\u00a0kg?1) greater than previously considered toxic, which requires further evaluation of critical Mn concentrations.",

        "Comment": "Long-term agricultural experiments are used to test the effects of different farm management practices on agricultural systems over time. The time-series data from these experiments is well suited to understanding factors affecting soil health and sustainable crop production and can play an important role for addressing the food security and environmental challenges facing society from climate change. The data from these experiments is unique and irreplaceable. We know from the Rothamsted experience that the datasets available are valued assets that can be used to address multiple scientific questions, and the reuse and impact of the data can be increased by making the data accessible to the wider community. However, to do this requires active data stewardship. Long-term experiments are also available as research infrastructures, meaning external researchers can generate new datasets, additional to the routine data collected for an experiment. The publication of the FAIR data principles has provided an opportunity for us to re-evaluate what active data stewardship means for realising the potential of the data from our long-term experiments. In this paper we discuss our approach to FAIR data adoption, and the challenges for refactoring and describing existing legacy data and defining meaningful linkages between datasets.",

        "Comment": "We investigated the relationship between soil pH calcium content and species richness of vascular plants in seven broadly defined Central European vegetation types, using Ellenberg indicator values for soil reaction and a phytosociological data set of 11,041 vegetation sample plots from the Czech Republic. The vegetation types included (A) broad-leaved deciduous forests, (B) meadows, (C) dry grasslands, (D) reed-bed and tall-sedge vegetation, (E) fens and transitional mires, (F) perennial synanthropic vegetation and (G) annual synanthropic vegetation. Relationships between local species richness (alpha diversity) and pH calcium were positive for vegetation types A and C, negative for D and G, unimodal for E, and insignificant for B and F. Ellenberg soil reaction values explained 37% of variation in local species richness for vegetation type E, 24% for A, 13% for D, but only less than 4% for the others. Species pool size, i.e., the number of species that can potentially occur in a given habitat, was calculated for each plot using Beals index of sociological favourability applied to a large phytosociological database. For most vegetation types, the relationships between species pool size and pH calcium were similar to the relationships between local species richness and pH calcium, with the exception of meadows (weak unimodal) and perennial synanthropic vegetation (weak negative). These patterns suggest that for those types of Central European vegetation that developed independently of human influence in the Pleistocene or early Holocene (dry grasslands, deciduous forests), there are larger pools of calcicole than calcifuge species. This pattern is also found at the level of local species richness, where it is, however, less clearly pronounced, possibly due to the predominance of a few widespread and generalist calcifuges in acidic habitats. The unimodal pattern found in mires may result from similar underlying mechanisms, but in high pH environments mineral-rich spring waters probably decrease species richness by having toxic effects on plant growth. By contrast, vegetation types developed under direct human influence (meadows, synathropic vegetation) show weak negative or no relationships of local species richness or species pool to pH calcium gradient. These results support the hypothesis of PARTEL (Ecology 83: 2361-2366, 2002) and EWALD (Folia Geobot. 38: 357-366, 2003), that the modem calcicole calcifuge disparity in the species pool of Central European flora has resulted from historical and evolutionary processes that took place on high pH soils. In the Pleistocene, calcareous soils dominated both the dry continental landscapes of Central Europe and glacial refugia of temperate flora, which were mostly situated in southern European mountain ranges with abundant limestone and dolomite. The negative pattern of species richness along the pH calcium gradient found in reed-bed and tall-sedge vegetation, however, is not consistent with this historical explanation.",

They provide a resource for evaluating biological, biogeochemical, and environmental dimensions of agricultural sustainability; for predicting future global changes; and for validating model competence and performance. A systematic assessment is needed to determine the merits of all known experiments and to identify any that may exist in tropical and subtropical environments. The establishment of an international network to coordinate data collection and link sites would facilitate more precise prediction of agroecosystem sustainability and future global change.",

        "Comment": "Analyses of precipitation at Rothamsted began in 1853 and have continued periodically. Soil and plant samples have been taken at intervals from the permanent grassland of the Park Grass Experiment (begun in 1856) and from the deciduous woodland of the Broadbalk and Geescroft Wilderness Experiments (begun in the 1880s). By combining precipitation chemistry with minimum estimates of other inputs, the relative importance of atmospheric deposition to acid inputs can be estimated, as well as the effect of these on the composition and yield of grassland and woodland in these particular soils. Acid rain (wet deposited H+) has been a negligible source of acidity throughout the experiments. Total atmospheric deposition, including dry deposited SO2 and NOx, and NH4 total acidifying inputs when soils are at or near pH 7 and up to 70% in more acid soil. Acidification slightly reduces the yield of herbage and the number of species present in grassland and the stand weight of woodland; different tree species dominate acid woodland soils. There has been greater acidification under deciduous woodland than grassland which is not grazed. This has important implications for the possible move of land from agriculture into forestry or agroforestry.",

        "Comment": "There is growing concern about declines in pollinator species, and more recently reservations have been expressed about mismatch in plant-pollinator synchrony as a consequence of phenological change caused by rising temperatures. Long-term changes in honeybee Apis mellifera phenology may have major consequences for agriculture, especially the pollinator market, as well as for honey production. To date, these aspects have received only modest attention. In the current study, we examine honeybee and beekeeping activity in southern Poland for the period 1965\u20132010, supplemented by hive yields from a beekeeper in southern UK in the same period. We show that despite negative reports on honeybee condition, and documented climate change, the studied apiary managed to show a marked increase in honey production over the 46 year study period, as did that from the UK. The proportion of the annual yield originating from the first harvest decreased during the study period and was associated with rising temperatures in summer. Honeybee spring phenology showed strong negative relationships with temperature but no overall change through time because temperatures of key early spring months had not increased significantly. In contrast, increasing yields and an increased number of harvests (and hence a later final harvest and longer season) were detected and were related to rising temperatures in late spring and in summer.",

        "Comment": "Biosolids are an important potential source of plant-available nutrients and also contain valuable quantities of stable organic matter, which can provide long-term benefits to soil structure and fertility. In this study, the long-term impacts of biosolids recycling to agricultural land on soil quality and fertility were assessed using established experimental platforms at four sites in England with contrasting soil types and agroclimatic conditions. At each site, treatment plots that had received 20 annual additions of biosolids (i.e., three types of digested sludge cake) at rates of 2.9 to 3.4 t ha(-1) y(-1) since 1994 were used in comparison with an untreated control treatment (which had received inorganic fertilizers only) to quantify the effects of biosolids on soil physical, chemical, and biological properties. Significant increases (P < 0.05) in soil organic matter (SOM) of 10% to 17% and in \"light fraction\" SOM(up to 2.9 mg kg(-1) on the biosolids treatment compared with 1.8 mg kg(-1) on the untreated control), along with a significant (P < 0.01) increase of up to 10% in available water capacity and numerical increases in water infiltration rate and aggregate stability, were found in plots that received biosolids. These plots also had significant (P < 0.05) increases of up to 20%, 48%, and 30% in soil total nitrogen, extractable phosphorus, and total sulfur, respectively. Earthworm numbers and weights were approximately doubled relative to the untreated control (P < 0.05) where low-metal biosolids had been applied. These results indicate that applying biosolids to agricultural land is an important means of replenishing and maintaining SOM levels. Importantly, no adverse effects on crop quality were observed. The results from this study provided valuable evidence toward maintaining a sustainable agricultural landbank for biosolids recycling in the United Kingdom.",

        "Comment": "Sulphur transformations were monitored in a unique set of arable, grassland and woodland soils from the Broadbalk Classical Experiment, which started in 1843. In an open incubation experiment with periodic leaching, 14-35 mg SO42--S kg(-1) was mineralised in 28 weeks at 25 degreesC, equivalent to 4.4-8.3% soil organic S. Cumulative amounts of S mineralised increased linearly during the 28 weeks, indicating constant rates of mineralisation. The rate of mineralisation was the greatest in the woodland soil (170 mug SO4-S kg(-1) day(-1)), followed by the grassland (120 mug SO4-S kg(-1) day(-1)) and the arable soil from the farmyard manure (FYM) plot (110 mug SO4-S kg(-1) day(-1)). Three soils from arable plots receiving different inorganic fertiliser treatments but no FYM had similar rates of S mineralisation (similar to 70 mug SO4-S kg(- 1) day(-1)). an incubation experiment with 35SO(4)(2)(-), addition of glucose greatly enhanced S immobilisation. In 132 days, the woodland and grassland soils immobilised more S than the arable soils, with or without glucose amendment. Immobilisation and mineralisation of S occurred concurrently, and both were stimulated by glucose addition. The results show that S mineralisation and immobilisation were influenced strongly by the type of land-use and long-term organic manuring, whereas annual application of sulphate-containing fertilisers for over 150 years had few effects on short-term S transformations.

        "Comment": "Methane uptake by a temperate arable soil was investigated in incubation experiments with intact soil cores. The measurements were carried out with a soil moisture content of 16-17% (w/w) and at 25 deg C. The decrease of the CH4 concn in an amended atmosphere (10 mu litre CH4/litre) was measured during a 212 h period. There was no decrease of CH4 if the soil was autoclaved showing that the disappearance of methane was entirely mediated by microbial activity. The long-term application (140 yr) of mineral nitrogen fertilizer caused significant differences in the ability of the soil to oxidize CH4: the larger the amount of fertilizer applied the lower rate of CH4 oxidation. No significant short-term effect of mineral-N fertilization could be observed whether applied as (NH4)SO4 or KNO3. An organic manure treatment, which has received nearly 240 kg N/ha each year as farmyard manure, showed almost the same ability to oxidize CH4 as an unfertilized plot and had a significantly higher CH4 oxidation rate after an application of 144 kg N/ha as nitrate fertilizer. For the mineral-N treatments the inhibition of the CH4 oxidation increased with increasing N turnover rate but was independent of the mineral nitrogen content of the soil at the time of measurement. Therefore, the continued application of mineral-N fertilizer for an extended period (at least 7 yr) caused a depletion of the bacterial methane sink in soil and may have contributed to the continuous increase in atmospheric CH4 over the past decades.",

        "Comment": "Ecological intensification (EI) could help return agriculture into a \u2018safe operating space\u2019 for humanity. Using a novel application of meta-analysis to data from 30 long-term experiments from Europe and Africa (comprising 25,565 yield records), we investigated how field-scale EI practices interact with each other, and with N fertilizer and tillage, in their effects on long-term crop yields. Here we confirmed that EI practices (specifically, increasing crop diversity and adding fertility crops and organic matter) have generally positive effects on the yield of staple crops. However, we show that EI practices have a largely substitutive interaction with N fertilizer, so that EI practices substantially increase yield at low N fertilizer doses but have minimal or no effect on yield at high N fertilizer doses. EI practices had comparable effects across different tillage intensities, and reducing tillage did not strongly affect yields.",

        "Comment": "Microbial communities in soil are highly species-rich, recognition of which has led to the view that functional redundancy within communities may buffer many impacts of altered community structure on soil functions. In this study we investigated the impact of long-term (>50 years) exclusion of plantinputs (bare-fallow treatment) on soil microbial community structure and on the ability of the microbial biomass to mineralise tracer additions of 13C-labelled plant-derived C-substrates. Exclusion of plantinputs resulted in depletion of soil organic matter (SOM) and a reduction in microbial biomass size. The microbial community structure was also strongly affected, as indicated by the distinct phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles in bare-fallow and grassland soils. Mineralisation of labile plant-derived substrates was not perturbed by the bare-fallow treatment. The incorporation of labile plant-derived C into PLFA biomarkers was found to differ between soils, reflecting the distinct community structures of the soils and indicating that these substrates were utilised by a broad range of microbial groups. In contrast, the mineralisation of recalcitrant plant-derived substrates was reduced in bare-fallow soil and the fate of substrate-derived C within PLFA biomarkers was, initially, similar between the soils. These results indicate that utilisation of these recalcitrant substrates was a function restricted to specific groups, and that exclusion of plant-derived inputs to soil had reduced the capacity of bare-fallow microbial communities to utilise this substrate type. Therefore, the study suggests that long-term selective pressure on microbial communities, resulting in altered community structure, may also result in altered functional attributes. This structureefunction relationship was apparent for utilisation of recalcitrant plant-derived substrates, but not for the more widely distributed attribute of labile C-substrate utilisation.",

        "Comment": "Maintaining an adequate phosphorus (P) supply for plants and microorganisms is central to agricultural production; however, the long-term effects of organic manure and inorganic fertilizer application on soil P cycling remain unclear. Organic P cycling in a sandy loam soil receiving medium and high rates of farmyard manure (FYM) with and without mineral fertilisers was studied in a long-term field experiment with\u00a014C/33P isotope labelling and metagenomic shotgun sequencing. FYM application alone negatively affected soil total P and organic P (Po) accumulation by enhancing crop offtake, enhancing Po mineralisation and stimulating P loss from the topsoil by reducing its P sorption potential. The P mineralisation/immobilisation rates detected by the\u00a033P pool dilution method were significantly correlated with the abundance of microbial P cycling genes. Soil available C and N concentrations were related to gross P mineralisation/immobilisation rates and the abundance of P uptake/scavenging genes. Microbial genes related to P uptake and metabolism were more abundant than P scavenging genes, while P scavenging genes may work efficiently as both of them can sustain similar P mineralisation and immobilisation rates. The addition of FYM also promoted phosphatase activity reflecting the increased supply of Po in these soils. Our study demonstrates that long-term FYM application alters soil Po stocks and cycling, and that microbial functional gene abundance was coupled with P cycling rates. ",

        "Comment": "In the context of climate change, at the end of the last century, humus became the centre of attention. Long-term field experiments (LTEs) are indispensable for practical soil research and for solving current problems. The evaluation of 79 long-term experiments worldwide leads to the following statements: All considerations on humus require a distinction between permanent and nutrient humus. Permanent humus is long-term stable. It is defined as humus content that is not undershot under field conditions in the absence of any fertilization and cultivation of humus-eating crops (bare fallow). In the European LTEs, the content of permanent humus C is mainly between 0.3% Corg (sandy soil) and 1.5% Corg (black earth). 90% of the organic primary substances fed to the soil, based on the starting material of vegetable biomass, are re-mineralized and returned to the atmosphere. The contents of total humus C are between 0.15% Corg and 2.29% Corg over 68 LTEs. In 31 out of 68 LTEs, the Corg content of the optimally organic and mineral fertilized variants was less than 1% Corg (=?1.724% humus). The nutrient humus C is 0.3% on average for 68 LTEs and often accounts for less than 0.2% of Corg, i.e. about 10 t/ha (at 4500 t/ha soil in the processing (A) horizon). On average across 68 LTEs, mineral fertilization increases the Corg content by 0.06 to 0.08% compared to \u201cunfertilized\u201d. On average across 42 LTEs, 11 t/ha of farmyard manure (FYM) annually increases the Corg content compared to \u201cunfertilized\u201d by 0.24% Corg. The mineral fertilizer ensures a high nutritional yield for the people and is also the basis of a sufficient humus supply. The results of 350 comparisons quantified the effect of combined organic-mineral fertilization compared to only optimal mineral fertilization, indicating that there was a 6% yield increase. Data indicate that models of organic carbon cycling in soils require permanent verification and calibration by representative LTEs. Data also show that current political goals for climate change mitigation via carbon sequestration on cropland, such as the 4 per 1000 initiative, are too optimistic. An annual increase in carbon content by 4\u2030 (or 1.2 billion tonnes of carbon every year) is practically impossible under the conditions of the twenty-first century, which means high yields and optimal organic and mineral fertilization.",

        "Comment": "Long-term field experiments are indispensable sources of knowledge. They are vitally important in monitoring, understanding and proving the changes in soil fertility occurring as a result of long-term agrotechnical operations, first of all that of fertilization. Because of longevity, it is fairly costly to maintain them. Their scientific and practical value is, however, immeasurable and keeps growing with their age. The information concerning the land use can not be replaced by other means. The oldest long-term experiments that have run continuously since their foundation are 160-years-old now. They were established at Rothamsted in England by the Rothamsted Experimental Station's founder J. B. Lawes and J. H. Gilbert in 1843. The scientific work of J. von Liebig, the German chemist, who drew up the theory of the increase of soil fertility, has also contributed to the foundation of the Rothamsted Classic Experiments to a large extent. In those days heated discussions about nutrient recycling incited the experimentation and scientific investigation. The experimentation in England has focused attention on long-term field experiments, and such experiments were soon set up in other lands too. In our days long-term experiments of more than 100 years can be found in six lands. These provide results characteristic first of all for the given site, however they concentrate attention on universally valid, surprisingly actual relations of cause and effect as well. These experiments are of great help to us to reconcile ecological and economic interests and to clear up actual questions of environmentally friendly nutrient supply and sustainable husbandry.",

        "Comment": "Land applications of municipal sewage sludge may pose a risk of introducing antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) from urban environments into agricultural systems. However, how the sewage sludge recycling and application method influence soil resistome and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) remains unclear. In the present study, high throughput quantitative PCR was conducted on the resistome of soils from a field experiment with past (between 1994 and 1997) and annual (since 1994) applications of five different sewage sludges. Total inputs of organic carbon were similar between the two modes of sludge applications. Intrinsic soil resistome, defined as the ARGs shared by the soils in the control and sludge-amended plots, consisted of genes conferring resistance to multidrug, beta-lactam, Macrolide-Lincosamide-Streptogramin B (MLSB), tetracycline, vancomycin, and aminoglycoside, with multidrug resistance genes as the most abundant members. There was a strong correlation between the abundance of ARGs and MGE marker genes in soils. The composition and diversity of ARGs in the five sludges were substantially different from those in soils. Considerable proportions of ARGs and MGE marker genes in the sludges attenuated following the application, especially aminoglycoside and tetracycline resistance genes. Annual applications posed a more significant impact on the soil resistome, through both continued introduction and stimulation of the soil intrinsic ARGs. In addition, direct introduction of sludge-specific ARGs into soil was observed especially from ARG-rich sludge. These results provide a better insight into the characteristics of ARG dissemination from urban environment to the agricultural system through sewage sludge applications.",

Previous LTSE studies have focused predominantly on statistical significance rather than effect size, whereas meta-analysis focuses on the magnitude and direction of an effect, i.e., the practical significance rather than its statistical significance. Results showed Zn to be the most toxic element causing an overall significant decrease in <i>Rhizobium</i> MPN of -26.6% during the LTSE. The effect of Cu showed no significant effect on <i>Rhizobium</i> MPN at concentrations below the UK limits, although a -5% decrease in <i>Rhizobium</i> MPN was observed in soils where total Cu ranged from 100 to <135 mg kg(-1). Overall, there was nothing to indicate that Cd had a significant effect on <i>Rhizobium</i> MPN below the current UK statutory limit. In summary, the UK statutory limit for Zn appears to be insufficient for protecting <i>Rhizobium</i> from Zn toxicity effects.",

        "Comment": "The Long-Term Sludge Experiments (LTSE) began in 1994 as part of continuing research into the effects of sludge-borne heavy metals on soil fertility. The long-term effects of Zn, Cu, and Cd on soil microbial biomass carbon (C-mic) were monitored for 8 years (1997-2005) in sludge amended soils at nine UK field sites. To assess the statutory limits set by the UK Sludge (Use in Agriculture) Regulations the experimental data has been reviewed using the statistical methods of meta-analysis. Previous LTSE studies have focused predominantly on statistical significance rather than effect size, whereas meta-analysis focuses on the magnitude and direction of an effect, i.e. the practical significance, rather than its statistical significance. The results presented here show that significant decreases in C-mic have occurred in soils where the total concentrations of Zn and Cu fall below the current UK statutory limits. For soils receiving sewage sludge predominantly contaminated with Zn, decreases of approximately 7-11% were observed at concentrations below the UK statutory limit. The effect of Zn appeared to increase over time, with increasingly greater decreases in C-mic observed over a period of 8 years. This may be due to an interactive effect between Zn and confounding Cu contamination which has augmented the bioavailability of these metals over time. Similar decreases (7-12%) in C-mic were observed in soils receiving sewage sludge predominantly contaminated with Cu; however, C-mic appeared to show signs of recovery after a period of 6 years. Application of sewage sludge predominantly contaminated with Cd appeared to have no effect on C-mic at concentrations below the current UK statutory limit. (C) 2016 The Authors.

        "Comment": "Long-term impacts of metal contamination derived from sewage sludge on soil microbial communities have been widely evaluated, but confounding effects have made it difficult to draw firm conclusions and thus to advise on safe metal limits. Here we used Multiplex-terminal restriction length fragment polymorphism (M-TRFLP) to assess the long-term impact of sludge-borne Zn and Cu contamination on the structure of bacterial, fungal and archaeal communities across seven different soils at metal levels relevant to current guideline limits. Despite strong effects of site on microbial community structure, analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) demonstrated a small but significant effect of Zn on bacteria (P < 0.001), archaea (P < 0.001), and fungi (P < 0.001). Significant effects of Cu on bacteria (P < 0.001), archaea (P < 0.001) and fungi (P < 0.001) were also observed. Several bacterial and fungal T-RFs were identified as responding to Zn or Cu. For example the bacterial T-RF 72 was negatively correlated with Zn and Cu, and T-RF 259 was positively correlated with Zn. Attempts to identify these bacterial markers of Zn and Cu contamination suggest a negative impact of Cu on Acidobacteria in arable soils. These results demonstrate for the first time, that despite a strong influence of site on microbial community structure, effects of Zn and Cu derived from sewage sludge can be detected as shifts in bacterial, fungal and archaeal communities indicating a common response more than 11 years after sludge addition.

        "Comment": "The Broadbalk Wheat Experiment at Rothamsted Research in the UK provides a unique opportunity to investigate the long-term impacts of environmental change and agronomic practices on plants and soils. We examined the influence of manure and mineral fertiliser applications on temporal trends in the stable N (N-15) and C (C-13) isotopes of wheat collected during 1968-1979 and 1996-2005, and of soil collected in 1966 and 2000. The Soil delta N-15 values in 1966 and 2000 were higher in manure than the mineral N supplied soil; the latter had similar or higher delta N-15 values than non-fertilised soil. The straw delta N-15 values significantly decreased in all N treatments during 1968 to 1979, but not for 1996-2005. The straw delta N-15 values decreased under the highest mineral N supply (192 kg N ha(-1), year(-1)) by 3 parts per thousand from 1968 to 1979. Mineral N supply significantly increased to straw delta C-13 values in dry years, but not in wet years. Significant correlations existed between wheat straw delta C-13 values with cumulative rainfall (March to June). The cultivar Hereward (grown 1996-2005) was less affected by changes in environmental conditions (i.e. water stress and fertiliser regime) than Cappelle Desprez (1968-1979). We conclude that, in addition to fertiliser type and application rates, water stress and, importantly, plant variety influenced plant delta C-13 and delta N-15 values. Hence, water stress and differential variety response should be considered in plant studies using plant delta C-13 and delta N-15 trends to delineate past or recent environmental or agronomic changes.

        "Comment": "The Rothamsted Drain Gauges built in 1870 comprise blocks of soil, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5m deep, isolated laterally by brickwork and undermined for the collection of drainage water but other wise undisturbed. The soil has not been cropped, manured or cultivated subsequently. The annual nitrate leakages from thse blocks were recorded for the 38 years from 1877/8 to 1914/5. The soil in the 0.5 and 1.5-m gauges lost on average about 45 kg ha-1 of nitrate-N per year during the first seven years of this period; that in the 1.0-m gauge lost slightly less. The overall decline in leakage was masked by large annual fluctuations attributable mainly to variation in rainfall. Fitting a simple function that assumed an exponential decline and took account of rainfall fluctuations gave a rate constant for each gauge from which the half-life could be estimated for the organic nitrogen feeding the leakage. The half-life of the 1.5-m gauge was 41 yr. The average nitrate leakage during the first seven years of the record differs little from estimates of the current leakage from soil carrying fully fertilized crops of winter wheat. This and the long half-life of the leakage show that pollution of drainage water by nitrate will not be controlled by limited the use of fertilizer in the short term. ",

        "Comment": "Soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (N) contents are controlled partly by plant inputs that can be manipulated in agricultural systems. Although SOC and N pools occur mainly in the topsoil (upper 0.30 m), there are often substantial pools in the subsoil that are commonly assumed to be stable.We tested the hypothesis that contrasting long-term  management systems change the dynamics of SOC and N in the topsoil and subsoil (to 0.75 m) under temperate conditions.We used an established field experiment in the UK where control grassland was changed to arable (59 years before) and bare fallow (49 years before) systems. Losses of SOC and N were 65 and 61% under arable and 78 and 74% under fallow, respectively, in the upper 0.15m when compared with the grass land soil, whereas at 0.3\u20130.6-m depth losses under arable and fallow were 41 and 22% and 52 and 35%, respectively. The stable isotopes 13C and 15N showed the effects of different treatments. Concentrations of long-chain n-alkanes C27, C29 and C31 were greater in soil under grass than under arable and fallow. The dynamics of SOC and N changed in both topsoil and subsoil on a decadal time-scale because of changes in the balance between inputs and turnover in perennial and annual systems. Isotopic and geochemical analyses suggested that fresh inputs and decomposition processes occur in the subsoil. There is a need to monitor and predict long-term changes in soil properties in the whole soil profile if soil is to be managed sustainably. ",

        "Comment": "For many centuries manure application to the soil has been common practice. Organic amendments and fertiliser applications can increase crop yields and soil organic matter (SOM). However, the long-term impacts on soil physical fertility are often neglected. This study was carried out on the Broadbalk Wheat Experiment at Rothamsted, UK, established in 1843 on an Aquic/ Typic Paleudalf soil. Application of farmyard manure (FYM), N fertiliser and wheat straw on total organic C (C-T), labile C (C-L) and non-labile C (C-NL), total N (N-T), mean weight diameter (MWD) and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (K-unsat) were studied on wheat (Triticum aestivum) and adjacent woodland and pasture areas. Manure additions, N fertiliser and straw incorporation increased all C fractions, particularly the C-L fraction. The addition of 35 t ha(-1) year(-1) of FYM increased C-T to 2.5 times that of the control (no fertiliser) treatment and C-L to 5 times that of the control. With highest N application and straw returned, C-T increased by 1.3 times and C-L by 1.5 times that of the control treatment. There were linear relationships between rate of N fertiliser applied and all C fractions, with the rate of increase almost double with straw than straw removed. Manure application improved MWD, as did high N fertiliser additions with straw returned. Application of N fertiliser only increased MWD and K-unsat (at 10 mm tension) if straw was returned, while the addition of manure resulted in decreased K-unsat. The highest K-unsat rate was on the high N fertiliser, straw returned treatments. The uncropped areas all had high soil structural stability. Similar relationships occurred between all C fractions and NT and MWD for the high C soils, but relationships were much stronger with C-L than the other C fractions in the low C soils. These results showed that soils with low C concentration are more reliant on C-L for structural stability. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Comment": "Manure is a source of plant nutrients and can make a valuable contribution to soil organic matter (SOM). Two experimental sites were studied on a Halpic Phaeozem soil near Bad Lauchstadt in Germany. The first experiment, called the static experiment, commenced in 1902. The impact of fresh farmyard manure (FYM) (0, 20 and 30 t ha(-1) 2 year(-1)) combined with P, K and N fertiliser application on total organic C (C-T) labile C (C-L), non-labile C (C-NL), total N (N-T) mean weight diameter (MWD) and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (K-unsat) was investigated. The second experiment commenced in 1984 and investigated the effect of extreme rates of fresh FYM applications (0, 50, 100 and 200 t ha(-1) year(-1)) and cropping, or a continuous tilled fallow on the same soil properties. At both sites a nearby grassland site served as a reference. On the static experiment, FYM application increased all C fractions, particularly C-L, where application of 30 t ha(-1) 2 year(-1) increased C-L by 70% compared with no FYM application. Fertiliser additions to the static experiment had a positive influence on C fractions while NT increased from both FYM and fertiliser application. MWD increased as a result of FYM application, but did not reach that of the grassland site. Both fertiliser and FYM application increased K-unsat (10 mm tension) on the static experiment. In the second experiment application of 200 t ha(-1) year(-1) of FYM increased concentrations of C-L by 173% and of C-NL by 80%, compared with no FYM application to make them equivalent to, or greater than the grassland site. A continuously tilled fallow resulted in significant decreases in all C fractions, NT and MWD compared with the cropped site, while K-unsat (10 mm tension) was increased on the 0 and 50 t ha(-1) year(-1) treatments as a result of a recent tillage. There was no difference in K-unsat between the cropped and the continuous tilled fallow at FYM applications of 100 and 200 t ha(-1) year(-1). There were similar significant positive correlations of all C fractions and N-T with MWD on both experimental sites but the relationships were much stronger on the extreme FYM experiment. Weaker relationships of C fractions and N-T with K-unsat (10 mm tension) occurred for the static experimental site but these were not significant for the extreme FYM experimental site. The strongest relationship between C fractions and K-unsat was with C-L. This research has shown that applications of FYM can increase SOM and improve soil physical fertility. However, the potential risk of very high rates of FYM on the environment need to be taken into consideration, especially since the application of organic materials to soils is likely to increase in the future.

In archived samples of wheat grain and leaves obtained from the Rothamsted Broadbalk experiment archive (1844-2003), amounts of wheat, Phaeosphaeria nodorum and Mycosphaerella graminicola DNA were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Relationships between amounts of pathogens and environmental and agronomic factors were examined by multiple regression. Wheat DNA decayed at approx. 1% yr(-1) in stored grain. No M. graminicola DNA was detected in grain samples. Fluctuations in amounts of P. nodorum in grain were related to changes in spring rainfall, summer temperature and national SO2 emission. Differences in amounts of P. nodorum between grain and leaf were related to summer temperature and spring rainfall. In leaves, annual variation in spring rainfall affected both pathogens similarly, but SO2 had opposite effects. Previous summer temperature had a highly significant effect on M. graminicola. Cultivar effects were significant only at P = 0.1. Long-term variation in P. nodorum and M. graminicola DNA in leaf and rain over the period 1844-2003 was dominated by factors related to national SO2 emissions. Annual variability was dominated by weather factors occurring over a period longer than the growing season.",

        "Comment": "Aims Most cereals accumulate Si in their shoots. Soil bioavailability of Si may be a constraint on the beneficial role of silica in cereals but it is not yet well supported by field data. The aim of this study is to evaluate the long-term impact of wheat straw exports on the pool of soil phytoliths, which, it is suggested, represents the most labile and renewable pool of soil Si. Methods We measured the  amorphous Si (ASi) in soils from several experiments at Rothamsted Research (UK), which provided long-term soil data back to the middle of the 19th century, using two alternative extraction techniques: Na2CO3 (referred to as ASnc) or zinc bromide extraction (referred to as ASizb). Results All samples showed a similar range of ASnc and ASizb but low values (0.1\u20133.4 mg g?1 DW) compared to published data on natural ecosystems. In the Broadbalk experiment, a decrease over time in ASi in the topsoil samples is in good agreement with the hypothesis that cropping and exports of straw leads to depletion of soil phytoliths. A decrease in Si concentration in straw samples was observed between 1883 and 1944. From 1944 to the present, Si concentration increased irregularly in the straw, probably as the result of liming, which enhanced the dissolution of the remaining phytoliths through increasing pH. In the reforested  Geescroft field the higher phytolith concentration in the modern topsoil samples is in good agreement with a re-building of phytolith storage from litter input in an acidic environment. Conclusions Our results therefore support the hypothesis that export of wheat straw leads to a decrease in bioavailable Si.",

        "Comment": "To meet economic and environmental demands for about 10 billion people by the mid-21st century, humanity will be challenged to double food production from the Earth's soil and diminish adverse effects of soil management on the wider environment. To meet these challenges, an array of scientific approaches is being used to increase understanding of long-term soil trends and soil-environment interactions. One of these approaches, that of long-term soil experiments (LTSEs), provides direct observations of soil change and functioning across time scales of decades, data critical for biological, biogeochemical, and environmental assessments of sustainability; for predictions of soil productivity and soil-environment interactions; and for developing models at a wide range of scales. Although LTSEs take years to mature, are vulnerable to loss, and have yet to be comprehensively inventoried or networked, LTSEs address a number of contemporary issues and yield data of special significance to soil management. The objective of this study was to evaluate how LTSEs address three questions that fundamentally challenge modern society: how soils can sustain a doubling of food production in the coming decades, how soils interact with the global C cycle, and how soil management can establish greater control over nutrient cycling. Results demonstrate how LTSEs produce significant data and perspectives for all three questions. Results also suggest the need for a review of the state of our long-term soil-research base and the establishment of an efficiently run network of LTSEs aimed at soil-management sustainability and improving management control over C and nutrient cycling.",

        "Comment": "The papers in this volume were presented at the British Ecological Society symposium held in the Oxford Forestry Institute on 13 July 1999. The aim was to bring together examples of different types of long-term monitoring in the UK. The papers (14) and posters/short papers (3) explore changes in British woods over periods ranging from 5 to 50 years in trees and shrubs, ground flora, invertebrates and birds. The work described deals both with natural processes such as stand dynamics, population cycles, phenology and interactions of plant host and invertebrates; and with human-induced effects - woodland management, air pollution and climatic change. As important as the results of the studies themselves, are the common threads that emerge with respect to the establishment and maintenance of long-term studies, the archiving and publishing of results, and the tension between trying to design systems are simple and might be useful to future researchers. The papers are: The human element in long term woodland studies; Long-term stand change in a near-natural oakwood on Clairinsh Island, Scotland (Mountford, E. P.); Long term structure and vegetation changes in a native pinewood reserve in northern Scotland (Edwards, C.; Mason, W.

        "Comment": "Natural succession of vegetation on abandoned farmland provides opportunities for passive rewilding to re-establish native woodlands, but in Western Europe the patterns and outcomes of vegetation colonisation are poorly known. We combine time series of field surveys and remote sensing (lidar and photogrammetry) to study woodland development on two farmland fields in England over 24 and 59 years respectively: the New Wilderness (2.1 ha) abandoned in 1996, and the Old Wilderness (3.9 ha) abandoned in 1961, both adjacent to ancient woodland. Woody vegetation colonisation of the New Wilderness was rapid, with 86% vegetation cover averaging 2.9 m tall after 23 years post-abandonment. The Old Wilderness had 100% woody cover averaging 13.1 m tall after 53 years, with an overstorey tree-canopy (? 8 m tall) covering 91%. By this stage, the structural characteristics of the Old Wilderness were approaching those of neighbouring ancient woodlands. The woody species composition of both Wildernesses differed from ancient woodland, being dominated by animal-dispersed pedunculate oak Quercus robur and berry-bearing shrubs. Tree colonisation was spatially clustered, with wind-dispersed common ash Fraxinus excelsior mostly occurring near seed sources in adjacent woodland and hedgerows, and clusters of oaks probably resulting from acorn hoarding by birds and rodents. After 24 years the density of live trees in the New Wilderness was 132/ha (57% oak), with 390/ha (52% oak) in the Old Wilderness after 59 years; deadwood accounted for 8% of tree stems in the former and 14% in the latter. Passive rewilding of these \u2018Wilderness\u2019 sites shows that closed-canopy woodland readily re-established on abandoned farmland close to existing woodland, it was resilient to the presence of herbivores and variable weather, and approached the height structure of older woods within approximately 50 years. This study provides valuable long-term reference data in temperate Europe, helping to inform predictions of the potential outcomes of widespread abandonment of agricultural land in this region.",

        "Comment": "Long-term field experiments (LTEs) play an important role in studying the effects of different management strategies on the soil ecosystem. However, LTEs are very diverse regarding location, duration, experimental design or research question. therefore, in October 2020, experts on LTEs from five different European countries met in a virtual workshop to discuss how to ensure high quality in LTE research. Recommendations for the implementation and use of LTEs were drawn from the presentations and discussions based on the following topics: (1) design and statistical evaluation, (2) soil and plant parameters, (3) requirements for data archiving and modelling as well as (4) data management and repository. Furthermore, it was concluded, that international networks enable joint analyses of LTEs to gain a better understanding of long-term changes in crop production at different climate conditions. This knowledge can help to develop sustainable agricultural management strategies. Consequently, a close collaboration among different groups like BonaRes, GLTEN and IOSDV can strengthen the validity of LTE research.",

        "Comment": "Nutrient limitation is a major constraint in crop production in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Here, we propose a generic and simple equilibrium model to estimate minimum input requirements of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium for target yields in cereal crops under highly efficient management. The model was combined with Global Yield Gap Atlas data to explore minimum input requirements for self-sufficiency in 2050 for maize in nine countries in SSA. We estimate that yields have to increase from the current ca. 20% of water-limited yield potential to approximately 50\u201375% of the potential depending on the scenario investigated. Minimum nutrient input requirements must rise disproportionately more, with N input increasing 9-fold or 15-fold, because current production largely relies on soil nutrient mining, which cannot be sustained into the future.",

        "Comment": "We evaluated the \u201c4 per 1000\u201d initiative for increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) by analysing rates of SOC increase in treatments in 16 long-term experiments in south-east UK. The initiative sets a goal for SOC stock to increase by 4\u2030 yr-1 in the 0-40 cm soil depth, continued over 20 years. Our experiments, on 3 soil types, provided 114 treatment comparisons over 7-157 years. Treatments included organic additions (incorporated by inversion ploughing), N fertilizers, introducing pasture leys into continuous arable systems, and converting arable land to woodland. In 65% of cases, SOC increases occurred at >7\u2030 yr-1 in the 0-23 cm depth, approximately equivalent to 4\u2030 yr-1 in the 0-40 cm depth. In the two longest running experiments (>150 yrs) annual farmyard manure (FYM) applications at 35 t fresh material ha-1 (equivalent to approx. 3.2 t organic C ha-1 yr-1) gave SOC increases of 18 and 43\u2030 yr-1 in the 23cm depth during the first 20 years. Increases exceeding 7\u2030 yr-1 continued for 40-60 yrs. In other experiments, with FYM applied at lower rates or not every year, there were increases of 3-8\u2030 yr-1 over several decades. Other treatments gave increases between zero and 19\u2030 yr-1 over various periods. We conclude that there are severe limitations to achieving the \u201c4 per 1000\u201d goal in practical agriculture over large areas. The reasons include (a) farmers not having the necessary resources (e.g. insufficient manure); (b) some, though not all, practices favouring SOC already widely adopted; (c) practices uneconomic for farmers \u2013 potentially overcome by changes in regulations or subsidies; (d) practices undesirable for global food security. We suggest it is more realistic to promote practices for increasing SOC based on improving soil quality and functioning as small increases can have disproportionately large beneficial impacts, though not necessarily translating into increased crop yield.",

It is an account of a unique discovery in the history of science: the synthetic production of ammonia from the elements, known today as the Haber-Bosch process. The story illustrates how we are able to change our lives through scientific investigation to make possible the previously inconceivable. Despite our accomplishments, however, we still have difficulty answering basic questions. What is science? And how does science work? It is certainly more than an exclusive engagement with hard facts and truths, as is often posited. At its core, science may be characterized as the interpretation of experimental observations within a theoretical framework (although preliminary planning and equipment are also required). Fittingly or paradoxically, the way in which science works cannot be described so succinctly. My attempt to formulate an answer fills the pages of this book. And as the pages demonstrate, performing scientific research is not an exact science (hah!). Scientific research is a trade. Science thrives on the accumulated knowledge of past generations and science exists because we practice it  ",

        "Comment": "Long-term experiments like those at Rothamsted in southeast England offer the best practical means of studying the effects of land management or global change on soil fertility, sustainability of yield or wider environmental issues. For the data from such experiments to be of use, farmers, scientists and policy makers must be certain of their validity. This is best assured by the rigorous management of the experiment, by ensuring that any changes are carefully considered and that all operations are well-documented. A steady flow of well- interpreted, published data is also essential. This paper gives examples of how the long-term field experiments at Rothamsted have been managed and how modifications have been made to ensure their relevance to modem agriculture.",

        "Comment": "Differences in agricultural management and land use lead to differences in soil structure, soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics and composition. We investigated the SOM composition at three depth layers in a permanent pasture (PP), an organic arable (OA) and a conventional arable (CA) field within one soil series in marine loam deposits in The Netherlands. Both arable fields were in the grass phase of the rotation. The chemical composition of SOM was determined by a combination of conventional pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and of thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM) with tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH). In PP, SOM was composed of relatively little decomposed, mainly grass-derived material comprising polysaccharides, lignin, aliphatic compounds (extractable lipids, cutin, suberin) and proteins, With depth, plant-derived constituents decreased, whereas microbial and humified material predominated. Both arable soils contained mainly strongly humified plant material and microbially altered proteineous material that showed heterocyclic N-compounds together with alkylbenzenes and phenols upon pyrolysis. With THM small traces of plant-derived alkanols and cutin/suberin were observed in the arable soils. The upper layers of OA contained little lignin, which can only be derived from the grass vegetation or manure inputs since last ploughing (2 years before) since it was not found in the whole plough layer. Overall SOM composition is therefore hardly affected by organic farming compared to conventional management. The differences in SOM content and composition between the pasture and arable fields can be ascribed to differences in input and depth distribution of fresh organic materials. But a difference in physical protection of easily mineralisable SOM between pasture and arable soils is also likely to contribute. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

We included both agricultural field experiments and areas where 'traditional' farming is practised. Our aim is to ground-truth interpretation of delta(15)N values in archaeobotanical crop remains as evidence of past growing conditions and husbandry practices. The results confirm the potentially radical impact of manuring on delta(15)N values in cereals, depending on manuring level, but indicate only a slight effect on pulses, which can fix atmospheric nitrogen. The expected geographical trend towards greater delta(15)N with increasing climatic aridity is not apparent, probably because the growing conditions for crops are 'buffered' through crop management. Each of these observations has fundamental implications for archaeobotanical interpretation of delta(15)N values as evidence of land use practices and (together with analysis of bone collagen/tooth enamel in potential consumers) palaeodiet.

        "Comment": "Nitrogen is the major determinant of crop yield and quality and the precise management of nitrogen fertilizer is an important issue for farmers and environmentalists. Despite this, little is known at the level of gene expression about the response of field crops to different amounts and forms of nitrogen fertilizer. Here we use expressed sequence tag (EST)-based wheat microarrays in combination with the oldest continuously running agricultural experiment in the world to show that gene expression is significantly influenced by the amount and form of nitrogenous fertilizer. In the Broadbalk winter wheat experiment at Rothamsted in the United Kingdom and at three other diverse test sites, we show that specific genes have surprisingly different expression levels in the grain endosperm when nitrogen is supplied either in an organic or an inorganic form. Many of the genes showing differential expression are known to participate in nitrogen metabolism and storage protein synthesis. However, others are of unknown function and therefore represent new leads for future investigation. Our observations show that specific gene expression is diagnostic for use of organic sources of nitrogen fertilizer and may therefore have useful applications in defining the differences between organically and conventionally grown wheat.",

        "Comment": "retention, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and porosity of two English soils: North Wyke (NW) grassland clay topsoil and Broadbalk silty topsoil, fertilized inorganically (PKMg) or with farmyard manure (FYM). As expected, the FYM topsoil had greater porosity and greater water retention than PKMg topsoil, and the NW clay topsoil retained more water at each matric potential than the silty topsoils. Compaction had a clear effect on water retention at matric potentials wetter than -10 kPa for the PKMg and FYM soils, corresponding to voids greater than 30 m cylindrical diameter, whereas smaller voids appeared to be unaffected. The Pore-Cor void network model has been improved by including a Euler &beta; distribution to describe the sizes of the narrow interconnections, termed throats. The model revealed a change from bimodal to unimodal throat size distributions on compaction, as well as a reduction in sizes overall. It also matched the water retention curves more closely than van Genuchten fits and correctly predicted changes in saturated hydraulic conductivity better than those predicted by a prior statistical approach. However, the changes in hydraulic conductivity were masked by the stochastic variability of the model. Also, an artifact of the model, namely its inability to pack small features close together, caused incorrect increases in pore sizes on compaction. These deficiencies in the model demonstrate the need for an explicitly dual porous network model to account for the effects of compaction in soil.",

        "Comment": "We followed in situ the evolution of nitrogen recently incorporated into a soil under maize culture for 4 years. Each year, a different pair of plots treated by removal or return of maize crop residues received a single pulse of N-15-labelled fertilizer. Unlabelled fertilizer was otherwise supplied. In parallel, plots supplied with unlabelled fertilizer received a single pulse of N-15-labelled maize crop residues. Varying weather affected total and fertilizer-derived N in the crop and residual inorganic N in the topsoil, but it did not affect fertilizer-N immobilization and remineralization. There was no consistent effect of crop residue return on total soil N, immobilization of fertilizer N, or the decay kinetics of recently immobilized N. Recently incorporated organic N from crop residues and microbial immobilization of inorganic N displayed similar mid-term decay kinetics. Crop residue N and immobilized N enter a labile compartment with an average residence time of a few months. A proportion, estimated at 28%, enters a more stable compartment from which the mineralization was imperceptible in 4 years. Particle-size fractions >50 mu m, which receive most of the crop residue N, retained it for only a short time. The mid-term stabilization of N was mainly in soil fractions <50 mu m.",

        "Comment": "The abundance and phylogenetic diversity of functional genes involved in nitrification were assessed in Rothamsted field plots under contrasting management regimes\u2014permanent bare fallow, grassland, and arable (wheat) cultivation maintained for more than 50\u00a0years. Metagenome and metatranscriptome analysis indicated nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) were more abundant than ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) in all soils. The most abundant AOA and AOB in the metagenomes were, respectively, Nitrososphaera and Ca. Nitrososcosmicus (family Nitrososphaeraceae) and Nitrosospira and Nitrosomonas (family Nitrosomonadaceae). The most abundant NOB were Nitrospira including the comammox species Nitrospira inopinata, Ca. N. nitrificans and Ca. N. nitrosa. Anammox bacteria were also detected. Nitrospira and the AOA Nitrososphaeraceae showed most transcriptional activity in arable soil. Similar numbers of sequences were assigned to the amoA genes of AOA and AOB, highest in the arable soil metagenome and metatranscriptome; AOB amoA reads included those from comammox Nitrospira clades A and B, in addition to Nitrosomonadaceae. Nitrification potential assessed in soil from the experimental sites (microcosms amended or not with DCD at concentrations inhibitory to AOB but not AOA), was highest in arable samples and lower in all assays containing DCD, indicating AOB were responsible for oxidizing ammonium fertilizer added to these soils.",

        "Comment": "Nitrogen-fixation was measured in illuminated laboratory incubations of soils containing different concentrations of Zn, Cu, Ni and Cd. The soils were taken from field experiments that had received either farmyard manure (low-metal soils) between 1942\u201367 or metal-contaminated sewage-sludge (high-metal soils) between 1942\u201361 so that the last metal inputs from sewage-sludge were more than 20 years ago. Colonies of blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) and other microorganisms developed rapidly on the surface of low-metal soil and after a 14 day lag there was a rapid increase in rate of C2H2-reduction, indicative of N2-fixation. C2H2-reduction reached a maximum rate after about 28 days then slowly declined. In contrast, colonisation of the surface of high-metal soil was very much poorer. C2H2-reduction only commenced after 50 days, reaching only about a third of the rate in the low-metal soil by 118 days, when the experiment ended. In another experiment the low-metal soil fixed about 10 times as much 15N-labelled N2 as the high-metal soil. The ratio C2H2 reduced-to-N2 fixed was 5. Measurements of total C2H2-reduction were made during a 60 day incubation on soils sampled on a transect from the middle of a low-metal farmyard manure (FYM) plot to the middle of a high-metal sludge plot. There was a negative correlation (r = ?0.78) between total C2H2-reduction and increasing distance along the transect, corresponding to increasing soil concentrations of Zn, Cu, Ni and Cd with increasing distance. Total C2H2-reduction was decreased by 50% at about 50 ?g EDTA-extractable Zn, 20 ?g Cu, 2.5 ?g Ni and 3 ?g total Cd g?1 soil. Because the amounts of metals in the soils were closely correlated with each other there was a similar relationship with Zinc Equivalent. At half the current permitted U.K. metal loading based on Zinc Equivalent, C2H2-reduction was also decreased by about 50%. ",

Survival of the isolates was compared in solutions containing different concentrations of Cu, Ni, Cd or Zn. The S-isolates from metal-contaminated soil were tolerant to larger concentrations of Cu, Ni, Cd and Zn compared to the F-isolates from uncontaminated control soil. The F-isolates were killed at concentrations of 0.002-mu-g ml-1 Cu, 0.2-mu-g ml-1 Cd 0.8-mu-g ml-1 Ni and 0.8-mu-g ml-1 Zn within 72 h, whilst the S-isolates survived, albeit in reduced numbers, at concentrations of 0.01-mu-g ml-1 Cu and 1.0-mu-g ml-1 Zn, but were killed by 1.0-mu-g ml-1 Ni and 0.8-mu-g ml-1 Cd within 72 h. A particularly strong increase in tolerance to Zn was shown by the S-isolates compared to other metals at the same concentrations. Thus, the order of decreasing toxicity in solution to the two F-isolates was Cu > Cd > Zn = Ni, but for the two S-isolates it was Cu > Cd > Ni > Zn. The S-isolates have multiple metal tolerance that enables them to survive in metal-contaminated soil, but they have lost their ability to fix nitrogen with <i>Trifolium repens L.</i> The F-isolates can fix nitrogen, but these do not survive in metal-contaminated soil because they lack tolerance to these metals.",

        "Comment": "Heavy reliance on pesticide inputs to maintain crop yields has been an important aspect of agricultural intensification. Insecticide use has had detrimental impacts on pollinators and natural pest control agents, contributing to a decline in associated ecosystem services, and has also led to resistance development in pest populations. Throughout Europe, in oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) crops, prophylactic use of insecticides against pollen beetles (Meligethes aeneus F. also known as Brassicogethes aeneus) has led to such issues, and there is an urgent need to develop more sustainable pest management practices for the crop. Although advice is available to oilseed rape growers regarding control thresholds, it may not be adhered to due to the expense of pollen beetle monitoring relative to the inexpensive cost of pyrethroid insecticides. Thus, the key to reducing prophylactic insecticide applications may lie with improved, less labour intensive methods of pollen beetle monitoring. For these to be realized, a better understanding is needed of the effects of agri-landscape features and meteorological conditions on pollen beetle immigration into the crop. In this study, based on data from four years of pollen beetle monitoring on a total of 41 field sites, we model the effects of meteorological (wind speed and direction, rainfall and accumulated temperature) and landscape (areas of woodland, residential gardens, the current and previous seasons' oilseed rape crops, and lengths of hedgerows and treelines) variables on directional sticky trap catches, at both the single trap and field scales. Meteorological variables, particularly accumulated temperature and wind speed were more important than landscape variables in predicting the abundance of pollen beetles immigrating into OSR fields. Sticky traps that were facing downwind caught more beetles than those that were facing across-wind or upwind; this is the first study to show at a landscape-scale, direct evidence for use of upwind anemotaxis by pollen beetles at the point of entry during immigration into the crop. At the field scale, the area of oilseed rape grown in the previous season was found to be positively related to trap catch, but no relationships with other landscape variables were found. Optimally-placed monitoring traps could complement existing decision support systems to reduce pollen beetle monitoring effort and encourage use of insecticides only when control thresholds are breached, thus enhancing the sustainability of oilseed rape production. Knowledge of the area of oilseed rape crops grown during the previous season in the surrounding landscape could contribute to risk assessment of potential pest pressure for individual OSR crops.

        "Comment": "Net uptake of CH4 was measured in intact soil cores (6.4 cm dia, 12 cm deep) collected from an arable wheat field, from three sites left uncultivated for more than 110 years following arable cropping and from a permanent grassland with different mineral N treatments subdivided into four pH levels. Soil cores were incubated in sealed 1 litre jars at 250 degrees C for 48 h with a CH4-amended atmosphere of 10 mu l 1(-1) at the start of incubation. The decrease in CH4 concentration followed first- order-kinetics and by log-transformation individual uptake rates could be calculated for each treatment. Soil from a calcareous site (PH 7.4) under deciduous woodland (Broadbalk Wilderness wooded section) oxidized CH4 6 times faster than the arable plot (pH 7.8) with the highest activity in the adjacent Broadbalk Wheat Experiment (with uptake rates of - 80 and - 13 nl CH4 1(-1) h(-1), respectively). The CH4 uptake rate was only 20% of that in the woodland in an adjacent area that had been uncultivated for the same period but kept as rough grassland by the annual removal of trees and shrubs and, since 1960, grazed during the summer by sheep. It is suggested that the continuous input of urea through animal excreta was mainly responsible for this difference. Another undisturbed woodland area with an acidic soil reaction (pH 4.1) did not oxidize any CH4. On a permanent grassland site (Park Grass Continuous Hay Experiment), the plot without N fertilization showed a distinct pH effect: CH4 consumption decreased from -67 to -35 nl CH4 1(- 1) h(-1) with decreasing pH in the range 6.3-5.6 and declined to zero between pH 5.6 and 5.1. Mineral N applied annually as (NH4)(2)SO4, at either 96 or 144 kg N ha(-1) for 130 years, completely inhibited CH4 oxidation, even where lime was applied to maintain a soil pH of about 6. By contrast, the long-term application of N as NaNO3 (96 kg N ha(-1) a(-1)) caused no decline in CH4 oxidation compared to unfertilized grassland at the same pH and, in some cases, caused a small increase. Withholding NH4-N for 3 years caused no significant recovery of CH4-oxidizing activity; withholding NO3-N caused a slight decline. Thus, land use (arable, cut grassland, grazed grassland or woodland), soil pH, N fertilizer inputs and form of N (NH4 or NO3) all have marked and interacting effects on the extent to which aerobic soil acts as a sink for CH4. The mechanisms through which the factors operate are not known but some possibilities are discussed. The results have important implications for the planning of land use and agricultural practices that will maximize the extent to which aerobic soils can act as a sink for CH4.",

        "Comment": "Liquid chromatography (LC) is increasingly used for analysing trace amounts of various compounds, including herbicides. A procedure was developed for the routine extraction and LC estimation of chlortoluron [N-(3 chloro 4 methylphenyl)-N' dimethylurea] residues from soils. More than 85% of chlortoluron was consistently recovered from treated Rothamsted and Woburn soils without recourse to the silica gel clean up procedure. Recovery from Barnfield silty loam was less, but still greater than 70% and very reproducible. Despite the imperfect separation of chlortoluron from the tailing band of material extracted from the soil, the extracts from untreated control soils did not contain substances which would interfere with the determination of chlortoluron at the 0.25 ppm level with the Rothamsted and Woburn soils, and at the 0.5 ppm rate with the Barnfield silty clay loam. A more extensive preliminary separation of the co extracted UV absorbing materials from the chlortoluron soil extracts permitted greater concentration of the extract with increased herbicide sensitivity. Thus, using the silica gel column clean up procedure the limits of assay were 0.1 ppm for Rothamsted and Woburn soils and 0.2 ppm for the Barnfield silty clay loam, with reproducible recoveries of 77, 73 and 64%, respectively. Under the chromatographic conditions described the peaks for the commonly used area herbicides diuron and monuron (retention times 4.2 and 5.0 min) overlap that of chlortoluron (retention time 3.7 min). The method can therefore only be used for the quantitative assay of chlortoluron in the absence of diuron and monuron, which are also extracted from soils by methanol.",

        "Comment": "This article considers how to estimate the overall trend in yields from the three unfertilized plots of the long-term Park Grass Experiment at Rothamsted, allowing for cross-correlation in the error terms from each plot. A regression model with common values of the explanatory variables is fitted to the yields from each plot. In this case the variance of the standard least squares estimators of a common parameter, the overall trend, may be obtained by fitting a regression model to the mean yield over the different plots, without the need to estimate the covariances between the error terms in the different datasets. To obtain the best linear unbiased estimator of the common parameter, a generalized least squares model must be fitted to the combined dataset. However, it is shown that when a regression model is fitted to several datasets in which the explanatory variables take identical values, the generalized least squares estimators will be the same as those obtained by standard least squares if the error terms all have the same variance, if error terms from the same dataset are independent, and if the correlations between corresponding error terms in different datasets are equal. A method of determining the significance of the product of probabilities from independent tests of significance is derived to allow for correlations between test statistics from different datasets. Inferences based on this method are compared with those obtained by estimating common parameters. \u00a91996 American Statistical Association and the International Biometric Society.",

        "Comment": "There is an urgent need to develop new high throughput approaches to phenotype roots in the field. Excavating roots to make direct measurements is labour intensive. An alternative to excavation is to measure soil drying profiles and to infer root activity. We grew 23 lines of wheat in 2013, 2014 and 2015. In each year we estimated soil water profiles with electrical resistance tomography (ERT), electromagnetic inductance (EMI), penetrometer measurements and measurements of soil water content. We determined the relationships between the measured variable and soil water content and matric potential. We found that ERT and penetrometer measurements were closely related to soil matric potential and produced the best discrimination between wheat lines. We found genotypic differences in depth of water uptake in soil water profiles and in the extent of surface drying. Penetrometer measurements can provide a reliable approach to comparing soil drying profiles by different wheat lines, and genotypic rankings are repeatable across years. EMI, which is more sensitive to soil water content than matric potential, and is less effective in drier soils than the penetrometer or ERT, nevertheless can be used to rapidly screen large populations for differences in root activity.",

        "Comment": "Our study tests the emerging paradigm that biochemical recalcitrance does not affect substantially long-term (50\u00a0years) SOC persistence. We analyzed the molecular composition of SOC in archived soils originating from four European long-term bare fallow experiments (Askov, Rothamsted, Versailles and Ultuna). The soils had been collected after various periods (up to 53\u00a0years) under bare fallow. With increasing duration of bare fallow without new organic inputs, the relative abundance of cutin- and suberin-derived compounds declined substantially, and the abundance of lignin-derived compounds was close to zero. Conversely, the relative abundance of plant-derived long-chain alkanes remained almost constant or increased during the bare fallow period. The relative abundance of N-containing compounds, considered to be abundant in SOC derived from microbial activity, increased consistently illustrating that microbial turnover of SOC continues even when plant inputs are stopped. The persistence of the different families of plant-derived compounds differed markedly over the scale of half a century, which may be ascribed to their contrasting chemical characteristics and recalcitrance, or to differences in their interactions with the soil mineral matrix, and likely some combination since chemical composition drives the degree of mineral association. Using soil from this unique set of long-term bare fallow experiments, we provide direct evidence that multi-decadal scale persistent SOC is enriched in microbe-derived compounds but also includes a substantial fraction of plant-derived compounds.",

        "Comment": "Metal-contaminated soils (produced by past long-term applications of contaminated sewage-sludge) from the Woburn Market Garden Field Experiment were previously shown to contain only about half the amounts of microbial biomass as other soils from the experiment which received farmyard manure during the same period. In some cases, the amounts of biomass in the metal-contaminated soils were even smaller than in other soils from the experiment which received inorganic fertilizer throughout. It is possible that the metals were causing decreased efficiency of substrate utilization by the microbial biomass. leading, in turn. to a smaller microbial population. This was investigated in a laboratory experiment by adding C-14-labelled glucose and C-14-labelled maize shoots (maize) separately to a metal-contaminated and a non-contaminated soil from the field experiment. Microbial biomass C, ninhydrin-N, soil ATP content and CO2 evolution were measured during the next 50 days following glucose addition and 100 days following maize addition in both soils. The biomass formed following addition of glucose or maize was consistently smaller in the metal-contaminated soil throughout the incubations. Overall, about 15-32% less glucose-derived and 25-60% less maize-derived biomass was formed in the metal-contaminated soil. In contrast, more CO2-C was evolved from the metal-contaminated soil than from the non-contaminated soil. This suggests that the biomass in the metal-contaminated soil was less efficient in the utilization of substrates for biomass synthesis. It is suggested that this may be a major reason for the smaller biomass in the metal-contaminated Woburn soils.",

        "Comment": "Our aim was to compare the soil microbial biomass concentration and its activity (measured as CO2-C evolved) following the rewetting and aerobic incubation of soils which have previously been stored air-dry for different periods. Some of the soils have been stored in the Rothamsted sample archive for 103 years, others were comparable freshly sampled soils following air-drying and rewetting and other soils were stored air-dry for 2 years then rewetted for the work described here. Following air-drying, soil ATP concentrations were variable in recently air-dried soil, comprising about 10-35% of the initial ATP concentrations in fresh soil. Following rewetting, the percentage recovery of ATP increased in all soils by 7 days, then declined to between 73% and 87% of the original ATP concentration in the air-dried soils by day 12. Storage of air-dried soils decreased the ability of the microbial biomass to restore its ATP concentrations. For example, the ATP concentration in a soil sampled from stubbed (i.e. tree seedling, saplings and bushes cut frequently to ground level) grassland of the Broadbalk continuous wheat experiment at Rothamsted then air-dried for 2 years was only about 14% of that in the fresh soil at 2 days after rewetting. In other soils from the Hoosfield Barley Experiment, also at Rothamsted, previously given NPK or FYM since 1852, and sampled then stored air-dry for between 13 and 83 years, from 52% to 57% of the ATP in the comparable fresh soils was measured at two days after rewetting. The soil ATP concentration then changed little more up to 12 days. One of the most interesting findings was that while the microbial biomass ATP concentration in the above NPK soils only ranged from about 2 to 4 mu mol ATP g(-1) biomass C, in the FYM soil the microbial biomass ATP concentrations (range 11.5-13.6 mu mol ATP g(-1) biomass C) were the same as we repeatedly measure in fresh moist aerobic soil. We do not yet know the reasons for this. More than twice as much CO2-C was evolved from the long-term stored soils than from freshly sampled ones. However, the specific respiration of the microbial biomass did not change much after the first 12 years of storage, indicating that loss of viability mainly occurred in the earlier years.

        "Comment": "Changes in soil microbiome diversity and function brought about by land management are predicted to influence a range of environmental services provided by soil, including provision of food and clean water. However, opportunities to compare the long-term effects of combinations of stresses imposed by different management approaches are limited. How soil is managed, particularly for agriculture, exerts stresses upon soil microbiomes, resulting in altered community structures and functional states. Understanding how soil microbiomes respond to combined stresses is important for predicting system performance under different land use scenarios, aids in identification of the most environmentally benign managements, and provides insight into how system function can be recovered in degraded soils. We use a long-established field experiment to study the effects of combined chronic (press) disturbance of the magnitude of organic carbon inputs with acute (pulse) effects of physical disturbance by tillage and chemical disturbance due to inorganic fertilization and pesticide application. We show that because of the variety of ways it can be assessed, biodiversity\u2014here based on microbial small subunit rRNA gene phylotypes\u2014does not provide a consistent view of community change. In contrast, aggregated traits associated with soil microbiomes indicate general loss of function, measured as a reduction of average genome lengths, associated with chronic reduction of organic inputs in arable or bare fallow soils and altered growth strategies associated with rRNA operon copy number in prokaryotes, as well as a switch to pathogenicity in fungal communities. In addition, pulse disturbance by soil tillage is associated with an increased influence of stochastic processes upon prokaryote community assembly, but fungicide used in arable soils results in niche assembly of fungal communities compared to untilled grassland. Overall, bacteria, archaea, and fungi do not share a common response to land management change, and estimates of biodiversity do not capture important facets of community adaptation to stresses adequately. IMPORTANCE Changes in soil microbiome diversity and function brought about by land management are predicted to influence a range of environmental services provided by soil, including provision of food and clean water. However, opportunities to compare the long-term effects of combinations of stresses imposed by different management approaches are limited. We exploit a globally unique 50-year field experiment, demonstrating that soil management practices alter microbiome diversity, community traits, and assembly. Grassland soil microbiomes are dominated by fewer\u2014but phylogenetically more diverse\u2014prokaryote phylotypes which sustain larger genomes than microbiomes in arable or bare fallow soil maintained free of plants. Dominant fungi in grassland soils are less phylogenetically diverse than those in arable or fallow soils. Soil tillage increases stochastic processes in microbiome assembly: this, combined with reduced plant biomass, presents opportunities for organisms with a capacity for pathogenesis to become established in stressed soils.

        "Comment": "Two classical articles were selected to represent the topic \"Milestones in Soil Organic Matter Studies\" for the special issue to celebrate the 90th anniversary of Soil Science. The first article, \"Comparative Study of Decomposition Rates of Organic Matter in Temperate and Tropical Regions,\" was authored by H. Jenny, S. P. Gessel, and F. T. Bingham and published in Soil Sci. 68:419-423, 1949. This article, which compared nitrogen and organic matter production and decomposition in temperate and tropical soils, has already been cited in more than 350 journal articles. The citing authors have used the Jenny et al. data to explain their own results in several ways including soil organic carbon increases, litter decomposition rates, dynamic modelling of soil organic matter formation, and ecological and forest ecosystem modelling. The second article, \"Turnover of Soil Organic Matter in Some Rothamsted Classical Experiments,\" was authored by D. S. Jenkinson and J. H. Rayner, Soil Sci. 123:298-305, 1977. This article has had a huge impact on considerations of soil organic matter turnover and has already been cited in upwards of 500 journal articles. The data were fundamental in the progression to the ROTHC model and has led to comparisons of other models such as CANDY, CENTURY, DAISY, and NCSOIL. Without a doubt, the articles by Jenny et al. and by Jenkinson and Rayner on organic amendments to soils, on biomass in soil from plant and microbial sources, and on the turnover of organic matter have contributed enormously to our abilities to predict the long-term stabilities of organic matter in the soil environment. But, there is much work still to be done. At last, we have the technologies that will enable us to understand the compositions and aspects of the structures of the plant and microbial tissues transformed to soil organic components that have degrees of resistance to degradation in the soil environment. Then, when we know better how the compositions/structures of these components are influenced by different soil properties, we will be in a better position to predict more accurately the behaviour of organic matter in different soil types under different management regimes.",

        "Comment": "Earthworms benefit agriculture by providing several ecosystem services. Therefore, strategies to increase earthworm abundance and activity in agricultural soils should be identified, and encouraged. <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i> earthworms primarily feed on organic inputs to soils but it is not known which organic amendments are the most effective for increasing earthworm populations. We conducted earthworm surveys in the field and carried out experiments in single-earthworm microcosms to determine the optimum food source for increasing earthworm biomass using a selection of crop residues and organic wastes available to agriculture. We found that although farmyard manure increased earthworm populations more than cereal straw in the field, straw increased earthworm biomass more than manures when milled and applied to microcosms. Earthworm growth rates were positively correlated with the calorific value of the amendment and straw had a much higher calorific value than farmyard manure, greenwaste compost, or anaerobic digestate. Reducing the particle size of straw by milling to <3 mm made the energy in the straw more accessible to earthworms. The benefits and barriers to applying milled straw to arable soils in the field are discussed. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",

        "Comment": "Mineral binding is a major mechanism for soil carbon (C) stabilization, and mineral availability for C binding critically affects C storage. Yet, the mechanisms regulating mineral availability are poorly understood. Here, we showed that organic amendments in three long-term (23, 154, and 170 yrs, respectively) field experiments significantly increased mineral availability, particularly of short-range-ordered (SRO) phases. Two microcosm studies demonstrated that the presence of roots significantly increased mineral availability and promoted the formation of SRO phases. Mineral transformation experiments and isotopic labeling experiments provided direct evidence that citric acid, a major component of root exudates, promoted the formation of SRO minerals, and that SRO minerals acted as \u201cnuclei\u201d for C retention. Together, these findings indicate that soil organic amendments initialize a positive feedback loop by increasing mineral availability and promoting the formation of SRO minerals for further C binding, thereby possibly serving as a management tool for enhancing carbon storage in soils.",

        "Comment": "Analyses of soil and hay samples collected from the Park Grass Experiment at Rothamsted during the last 137 years indicate slow but significant increases in KCl- and EDTA-extractable aluminium in soil and a sudden and very large recent increase in the concentration of aluminium in the herbage. The latter is associated with a sudden increase in the rate of acidification of the soil over the last 10-15 years and the mobilization of aluminium as the soil enters the aluminium buffer range - a Chemical Time Bomb. Such severe acidification from atmospheric inputs on a well-buffered soil illustrates how quickly an apparently stable situation can change as a result of acid deposition. It highlights the need to protect soils and plants from the effects of acidification by decreasing acid inputs or by liming.",

The model overcomes three shortcomings of existing models: (i) the model includes rain as a source of leaf wetness, (ii) the model is simple enough to be integrated in disease forecasting systems and (iii) the model only uses meteorological measurements available from standard meteorological stations. The model is tested using two data sets from sites on the experimental farm at Rothamsted Research, UK. Model performance is discussed on basis of (i) the performance of the model for predicting consecutive multiple day periods of leaf wetness duration above a threshold and (ii) the percentage of days where the model correctly/incorrectly predicts whether or not infections could occur. These criteria are important for forecasting both light leaf spot and stem canker in oilseed rape crops. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Comment": "Liming is widely used to reduce the impacts of soil acidification and optimize soil pH for agricultural production. Whether models can simulate the effect of liming on soil pH, and base saturation (BS), and thereby guide lime application, is still largely unknown. Long-term experimental data from a grassland (Park Grass, 1965-2012) and arable land (Sawyers Field, 1962-1972) at Rothamsted Research, UK, were thus used to assess the ability of the VSD+ model to simulate the effects of long-term fertilization and liming on soil acidification. The VSD+ model was capable of simulating observed soil pH and BS changes over time in the long-term liming experiments, except for a treatment in which sulphur (S) was added. Normalized Mean Absolute Errors (NMAE) and Normalized Root Mean Square Errors (NRMSE) of simulated and observed pH values, averaged over the observation periods varied between 0.02 and 0.08 (NMAE) and 0.01-0.05 (NRMSE). The acidity budget results for Park Grass suggest that nitrogen (N) transformations contributed most to acidity production, causing predominantly aluminium (Al) exchange in the topsoil (0-23 cm) followed by base cation (BC) release, but in the treatment with S addition, BC uptake had a nearly similar effect on acidity production. However, in Sawyers Field, the acidity budget suggested that BC uptake was the dominant cause of soil acidification, while the impacts of N transformations were limited. Liming was found to sufficiently replenish BC and decrease Al exchange in the topsoil layer. Overall, the VSD- model can adequately reconstruct the impacts of fertilizer and liming applications on acid neutralizing processes and related soil pH and BC changes at the soil exchange complex.

        "Comment": "Estimating spatially resolved grassland productivity is essential for benchmarking the total UK productive potential to assess food, feed and fuel trade-offs in the context of whole systems analyses. Our objectives were to adapt and evaluate a well-known process-based model (PBM) and estimate productivity of improved (permanent, temporary) and semi-natural grassland systems using meta-models (MM) trained by extensive PBM scenario simulations. Observed dry matter (DM) yields in multi-site nitrogen (N) response (0, 150 and 300 kg N ha(-1)) experiments were well emulated describing the average productivity of rough grazing, permanent and temporary grassland (3.1, 7.4 and 9.8 t DM ha(-1), respectively). Cross-vpalidated with independent and long-term data (Park Grass Experiment), the PBM explained more variation when considering all systems combined (81%) than across all improved grasslands (61%) but little for rough grazing (26%). The PBM-trained MMs explained 48, 72 and 70% of the simulated yield variation in the grasslands of increasing management intensity, and 43 and 75% of observed variation in the combined improved and all three grassland systems, respectively. Considering the assessment of ecosystem services, like drainage and water productivity, PBM scenario simulations are essential. Compared to improved grassland rough grazing will result in 40% more groundwater recharge due to its lower simulated water use and water productivity (12 versus 25 and 43 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) for permanent and temporary grassland, respectively).",

In a long-term agricultural experiment, pollution of soil by heavy metals from sewage sludge appears to decrease over time. This is explained by cultivation activity which disperses the pollution outside the treated plots. A two-dimensional diffusion model is adapted to quantify the rate of dispersal and is fitted to series of samples taken across the experiment. This demonstrates that most of the original pollution is still present in the soil. The effect of serial correlation of the observations is investigated but found not to affect the results.",

        "Comment": "A computer model is presented that describes the flow of nitrogen between crop and soil on the field scale. The model has a compartmental structure and runs on a weekly time-step. Nitrogen enters via atmospheric deposition and by application of fertilizer or organic manures, and is lost through denitrification, leaching, volatilization and removal in the crop at harvest. Organic nitrogen is contained within three of the model compartments - crop residues (including plant material dying off through the growing season), soil microbial biomass and humus. Inorganic nitrogen is held in two pools as NH4+ or NO3-. Nitrogen flows in and out of these inorganic pools as a result of mineralization, immobilization, nitrification, leaching, denitrification and plant uptake. The model requires a description of the soil and the meteorological records for the site - mean weekly air temperature, weekly rainfall and weekly evapotranspiration. The model is designed to be used in a 'carry forward' mode - one year's run providing the input for the next, and so on. The model also allows the addition of N-15 as labelled fertilizer, and follows its progress through crop and soil. Data from a Rothamsted held experiment in which the fate of a single pulse of labelled N was followed over several years were used to set the model parameters. The model, thus tuned, was then tested against other data from this and two contrasting sites in south-east England. Over a period of 4 years, the root mean square (R.M.S.) difference between modelled and measured quantities of labelled N remaining in the soil of all three sites was c. 7.5 kg N/ha, on average. The root mean square error in the measurements was c. 2.5 kg/ha. Similarly, the R.M.S. difference between modelled and measured recovery of labelled N by the crop was 0.6, compared with 0.3 kg/ha in the measurements themselves. ",

        "Comment": "Results of long-term fertilizer trials on the Park Grass hay plots at Rothamsted are described and a brief summary of recent work on the ecological genetics of Anthoxanthum odoratum which occurred on many plots, is given. There were significant differences between treatments in hay yield. Yields fell during the first 60 yr on most plots then remained stable from 1920-1960. The largest yield was obtained with high N plus P, K, Na and Mg fertilizers. Yields were increased on unlimed acid soils following liming between 1965 and 1968; extra lime on previously treated soils had little effect. On unfertilized plots about 50 spp. were present; Ca had little effect on botanical composition and P, K, Na and Mg together increased the proportion of legumes. Ammonium sulphate increased the proportion of acid-tolerant grasses including brown top, sweet vernal and Yorkshire fog. The flora of many plots changed slowly despite unchanging fertilizer treatment. Brown top and sweet vernal did not become dominant until the 1930's and 1950's, resp. Ca had large effects on acid and unlimed plots. There was little variation in N content and uptake between spp. and plots. P and K content were much greater when PK fertilizers were applied. Na content was low and decreased with K application. Mg content decreased as yield increased. Ca content was greatest with no manure and liming had little effect. ADDITIONAL ABSTRACT: Fertilizers have been applied annually since 1856 to permanent grassland cut for hay each year, and their effects compared with those of farmyard manure and no amendments. N as ammonium sulphate or sodium nitrate, P, K, Na, Mg and lime have been applied in various combinations and schedules. Yields have been recorded annually and the herbage has been analysed botanically and chemically in some years. Soil pH and nutrient content have also been assessed occasionally. This paper describes results for 12 of the 20 plots, and includes a brief summary of recent work on the ecological genetics of Anthoxanthum odoratum.",

        "Comment": "The dynamics of soil organic carbon are included in global carbon (C) cycle scenarios using different, but generally arbitrary defined, kinetic pools. To improve global C models, better relationships between the chemical structure of soil organic matter (SOM) and its kinetic pools are needed. To assess the molecular residence time of SOM and the relation with plant inputs, pyrolysis-GC/MS-C-IRMS was performed on maize plants and on two samples from the same soil that had undergone a vegetation change from the C3 plant wheat to the C4 plant maize. This vegetation change has added naturally C-13-enriched material to the soil. Most pyrolysis products from the maize were derived from polysaccharides and lignins, and were not detected in soils. However, polysaccharide-derived products were also major pyrolysis products in soils, N-containing or unspecific pyrolysis products were also detected. The residence times (based on C-13 natural labelling) revealed a continuum of values, that was independent of chemical structure, with only two pyrolysis products presenting a relatively long residence time (ca. 100 years). An unexpected long life-time for N-containing (similar to49 years) and polysaccharide-derived (similar to54 years) pyrolysis products was found. Our results suggest that mainly recycling of carbon in carbohydrates and N-containing materials in addition to physical and chemical protection is responsible for SOM stabilization in the slow carbon pool.

        "Comment": "To cope with phosphorus (P) deficiency, plants adapt root morphology to enhance inorganic P (Pi) acquisition from soil by allocating more biomass to roots, but whether the responses can be modified across gradients of P supply is not fully understood. The present study examined changes in root-length density (RLD), root-hair density (RHD) and root-hair length (RHL) of wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) in two contrasting soils, the Rough and Barnfield soils. Wheat plants were grown for 3 weeks in thin-plate rhizotrons in two soils with additions of 0, 10, 25, 50, 100 and 200 mg P/kg soil. Contrary to published literature, as P additions increased it was observed that a concomitant increase in RHL (250 to 1054 mu M in the Rough soil and 303-1075 mu M in the Barnfield soil) and RHD (57 to 122/mm in the Rough soil and 56-120/mm in the Barnfield soil), while RLD generally decreased (2480-1130 cm/cm(3) in the Rough soil and 1716-865 cm/cm(3) in the Barnfield soil). The levels of added P that resulted in critical P concentrations in the soils enabling maximum shoot biomass production were 50 mg/kg P in the Rough soil and 100 mg/kg P in the Barnfield soil, and these additions influenced root morphological changes. Under severe P deficiency, P supply increased RHL and RHD, but RLD was decreased. Improvement in lateral root and root-hair responses in wheat at extreme P deficiency may be a worthy target for breeding more sustainable genotypes for future agroecosystems.",

        "Comment": "This study presents results from a major grassland model intercomparison exercise, and highlights the main challenges faced in the implementation of a multi-model ensemble prediction system in grasslands. Nine, independently developed simulation models linking climate, soil, vegetation and management to grassland biogeochemical cycles and production were compared in a simulation of soil water content (SWC) and soil temperature (ST) in the topsoil, and of biomass production. The results were assessed against SWC and ST data from five observational grassland sites representing a range of conditions - Grillenburg in Germany, Laqueuille in France with both extensive and intensive management, Monte Bondone in Italy and Oensingen in Switzerland - and against yield measurements from the same sites and other experimental grassland sites in Europe and Israel. We present a comparison of model estimates from individual models to the multi-model ensemble (represented by multi-model median: MMM). With calibration (seven out of nine models), the performances were acceptable for weekly-aggregated ST (R-2 > 0.7 with individual models and > 0.8-0.9 with MMM), but less satisfactory with SWC (R-2 < 0.6 with individual models and < similar to 0.5 with MMM) and biomass (R-2 < similar to 0.3 with both individual models and MMM). With individual models, maximum biases of about -5 degrees C for ST, -0.3 m(3) m(-3) for SWC and 360 g DM m(-2) for yield, as well as negative modelling efficiencies and some high relative root mean square errors indicate low model performance, especially for biomass. We also found substantial discrepancies across different models, indicating considerable uncertainties regarding the simulation of grassland processes. The multi-model approach allowed for improved performance, but further progress is strongly needed in the way models represent processes in managed grassland systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

        "Comment": "Natural colonization for establishing multiple-use woodlands was evaluated using historical information and survey results from Broadbalk Wilderness, an area of colonization dating back to 1882, at Rothamsted, Hertfordshire, UK. The Broadbalk Wilderness woodland is of mixed deciduous type and covers a small area (0.15 ha). The 2 dominant tree species over the period reported (1945-95) are hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior), with the main other tree species oak (Quercus spp.), field maple (Acer campestre), sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus), holly (Hedera helix), wild cherry (Prunus avium) and yew (Taxus baccata). However, sycamore is now the second most abundant tree. The number of trees has increased from 104 in 1960 to 206 in 1995. The main advantages of colonization were that (1) it led to species matched to the site, (2) opportunities for conserving local genetic distinctiveness were maximized, and (3) the impact of the new woodland in the landscape was low due to prolonged, patchy establishment. The main disadvantages were that (1) establishment was unpredictable and slow, (2) without management little timber of any value has been produced, and (3) floral diversity was low on the site due to isolation from surrounding woodland. It is concluded that natural colonization has a role to play in creating new woodlands but that it should be driven by clear objectives and applied flexibly in relation to site characteristics.",

        "Comment": "Liming is a common agricultural practice worldwide, used for increasing productivity in acid agricultural soils. Liming reduces Al saturation and toxicity and/or increases pH up to values where the availability of nutrients is higher. The effect of this practice on soil properties has been extensively studied, with focus of most studies upon pH, exchangeable cations and productivity. In turn, the effects of liming on soil organic C (SOC) stocks still remain poorly known. The net effect on SOC can be the result of several factors: first, liming increases the soil biological activity, thus favoring the mineralization of organic matter, which should result in CO2 losses and a decrease of the SOC stocks. Second, liming ameliorates soil structure, increasing the stability of clay assemblages and clay-organic matter bonds, which should bring an increase in SOC physical and physicochemical protection. Finally, as liming ameliorates soil conditions to plant growth, plant productivity increases and also the return of C inputs to soil, thus potentially increasing SOC concentrations. The net effect of these processes is not well understood yet. Still, some overall trends can be deduced from data currently available in the literature. Liming does modify SOC stocks, increasing them in most cases, what seems to be caused by higher C inputs to limed soils due to increased productivity. Reductions in SOC have also been reported, probably in connexion with increased mineralization, whereas the role of improved soil structure remains unclear. Overall, these insights are deduced from published data which are still scarce, so we encourage the scientific community to synthesize unpublished SOC data from existing in situ experiments, in order to enlarge the span of experimental conditions and gain knowledge about the role of such a widespread agricultural practice on SOC stocks.

        "Comment": "This paper reviews some traditional and more recent methods for analyzing unreplicated experiments. Such experiments have presented a challenge to statisticians throughout their involvement in agricultural research. At Rothamsted this began in 1919, when R.A. Fisher was appointed to analyze the accumulated data from the classical field experiments. Fisher's experiences with the classicals, which had virtually no replication, must have contributed to his inclusion of replication as one of the key features of a well-designed experiment. Nevertheless, Fisher made good use of Rothamsted's data, for example in his study of the influence of rainfall on yields from the Broadbalk. He also devised the randomization test, which can be used to analyze unreplicated data. More recently, Broadbalk has also been used to study climate change and sustainability. Newer developments have been concerned to find alternatives to use, instead of blocking, to take account of the spatial variation within an experiment. The resulting methods for modeling spatial correlations have allowed experimenters to obtain more precise estimates of treatment effects-or to decrease numbers of replicates- and they can also provide reliable analyses of unreplicated treatments.",

        "Comment": "Amato and Ladd showed that the amount of ninhydrin-reactive nitrogen (ninhydrin-N) extracted from soil by 2 m KCl following chcl3 fumigation is a reliable and sensitive indicator of the amount of soil microbial biomass. However, when we attempted the assay in 0.5 m k2so4 soil extracts, serious analytical problems (e.g. precipitation of CaSO4 and K2SO4) occurred, which invalidated the ninhydrin-N determinations. As measurement of biomass C (and probably biomass N) in soils by fumigation-extraction is more reliable when K2SO4, rather than KCl, is used as the extractant, we modified the ninhydrin-N assay procedure to permit measurements in 0.5 m K2SO4. Our modified procedure is described. A strong relationship (r = 0.99) between ninhydrin-N measured in KCl and K2SO4 soil extracts was obtained (KCl-ninhydrin-N = 0.90 K2SO4-ninhydrin-N). There were also strong linear relationships (r = 0.91?95) between biomass C, biomass N and biomass ninhydrin-N (all extracted with 0.5 M K2SO4). We conclude that reliable ninhydrin-N measurements are obtained in 0.5 m K2SO4 soil extracts by our modified procedure.",

        "Comment": "Nitrate leaching was measured over the eight drainage seasons spanning nine years (1990-1998) on the 157-year old Broadbalk Experiment at Rothamsted, UK. The weather pattern of two dry, three wet and three dry years was the dominant factor controlling nitrogen (N) loss. Both the concentration of nitrate in the drainage waters and the amount of N leached increased with the amount of N applied, mostly because of long-term, differential increases in soil organic matter and mineralization. On average, losses of N by leaching were 30 kg ha-1year-1 when no more than the optimum N application was applied and were typical of amounts leached from arable land in the UK. Losses increased significantly in both amounts and as the percentage of N applied for supra-optimal applications of N and from autumn-applied farmyard manure (FYM). Extra spring-applied fertilizer was very effective at increasing yields on plots given FYM in the autumn but at the expense of leaching losses three times those from optimum fertilizer N applications. Losses increased after potatoes because they left significant amounts of mineral N in the soil, and decreased after forage maize because it used applied N more effectively. Losses measured 120 years ago from identical treatments were 74% greater than current losses because of today's larger yields and more efficient varieties and management practices. Average concentrations of nitrate in drainage waters did not exceed the EU limit of 11.3 mg NO3-N litre-1 until supra-optimal amounts of N fertilizer (>150-200 kg ha-1year-1) were applied in spring or FYM was applied in autumn. However, some drainage waters from all plots, even those that have not received fertilizer for >150 years, exceeded the limit when rain followed a dry summer and autumn. Nitrate leaching into waters will remain a problem for profitable arable farming in the drier parts of Eastern England and Europe despite increased N use efficiency.",

        "Comment": "Human activity has greatly perturbed the nitrogen cycle through increased fixation by legumes, by energy and fertilizer production, and by the mobilization of N from long-term storage pools. This extra reactive N is readily transported through the environment, and there is increasing evidence that it is changing ecosystems through eutrophication and acidification. Rothamsted Experimental Station, UK has been involved in research on N cycling in ecosystems since its inception in 1843. Measurements of precipitation composition at Rothamsted, made since 1853, show an increase of nitrate and ammonium N in precipitation from 1 and 3 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) respectively, in 1855 to a maximum of 8 and 10 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) in 1980, decreasing to 4 and 5 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) today. Nitrogen inputs via dry deposition do, however, remain high. Recent measurements with diffusion tubes and filter packs show large concentrations of nitrogen dioxide of c. 20 mu g m(-3) in winter and c. 10 mu g m(-3) in summer; the difference is linked to the use of central heating, and with variations in wind direction and pollutant source. Concentrations of nitric acid and particulate N exhibit maxima of 1.5 and 2 mu g m(-3) in summer and winter, respectively. Concentrations of ammonia are small, barely rising above 1 mu g m(-3). Taking deposition velocities from the literature gives a total deposition of all measured N species to winter cereals of 43.3 kg N ha(-1) yr(- 1), 84 % as oxidized species, 79 % dry deposited. The fate of this N deposited to the very long-term Broadbalk Continuous Wheat Experiment at Rothamsted has been simulated using the SUNDIAL N-cycling model: at equilibrium, after 154 yr of the experiment and with N deposition increasing from c. 10 kg ha(- 1) yr(-1) in 1843 to 45 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) today, c. 5 % is leached, 12% is denitrified, 30% immobilized in the soil organic matter and 53 % taken off in the crop. The 'efficiency of use' of the deposited N decreases, and losses and immobilization increase as the amount of fertilizer N increases. The deposited N itself, and the acidification that is associated with it (from the nitric acid, ammonia and ammonium), has reduced the number of plant species on the 140- yr-old Park Grass hay meadow. It has also reduced methane oxidation rates in soil by c. 15 % under arable land and 30 % under woodland, and has caused N saturation of local woodland ecosystems: nitrous oxide emission rates of up to 1.4 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) are equivalent to those from arable land receiving > 200 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), and in proportion to the excess N deposited; measurements of N cycling processes and pools using N-15 pool dilution techniques show a large nitrate pool and enhanced rates of nitrification relative to immobilization. Ratios of gross nitrification:gross immobilization might prove to be good indices of N saturation.",

        "Comment": "Nitrogen is an essential input factor required for plant growth and biomass production. However, very limited information is available on how nitrogen fertilization affects the quality of crop residues to be used as lignocellulosic feedstock. In the present study, straw of winter wheat plants grown at six different levels of nitrogen supply ranging from 48 to 288 kg nitrogen ha(-1) was analyzed for major cell wall components and mineral elements. Enzymatic digestion of the straw was carried out to evaluate the saccharification efficiency. The nitrogen concentration in the straw dry matter increased linearly from 0.32% to 0.71% over the range of nitrogen treatments. Cellulose and hemicellulose were not affected by the nitrogen supply while lignin peaked at medium rates of nitrogen application. The nitrogen treatments had a distinct influence on the silicon concentration, which decreased from 2.5% to 1.5% of the straw dry matter when the nitrogen supply increased from 48 to 192 kg ha(-1). No further decline in Si occurred at higher rates of nitrogen application. The most abundant metals in the straw were potassium and calcium and their concentrations almost doubled over the range of nitrogen supplies. The enzymatic saccharification efficiency was negatively correlated with the rate of nitrogen supply. We conclude that the level of nitrogen supply to wheat plants alters the composition of cell wall components in the straw and that this may result in reduced saccharification efficiency.

        "Comment": "The influence of various inorganic and organic fertilizers was assessed in three long-term \u201cclassical\u201d experiments and two short-term field experiments, one on grass and one on wheat. The long-term experiments included Broadbalk which had grown continuous wheat since 1843, Barnfield, continuous root crops since 1843 and Park Grass, continuous grass since 1836. Annual fertilizer treatments were farmyard manure (48 and 96 kg N ha?1), various forms of inorganic nitrogen (48, 96, 144 and 192 kg N ha?1), liquid and solid sewage sludge and sewage cake in a wide range of doses.  In the three arable experiments, all species of earthworms were more numerous in plots treated with organic fertilizers than in untreated plots. There was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.9825) between amounts of inorganic N applied and populations of earthworms. Plots receiving both inorganic and organic N had the largest populations of earthworms. The effects of both inorganic and organic N were much less on earthworm populations in grassland than on those in arable crops, even in the long-term experiments, and there was some evidence of adverse effects when an excessive amount of liquid sludge was applied in a single dose. Effects of organic fertilizers were greater on populations of <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i> than on those of <i>Allolobophora longa, A. caliginosa</i> or <i>A. chorotica</i>. ",

        "Comment": "Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) is one of the key indicators of land degradation. SOC positively affects soil functions with regard to habitats, biological diversity and soil fertility; therefore, a reduction in the SOC stock of soil results in degradation, and it may also have potential negative effects on soil-derived ecosystem services. Dynamical models, such as the Rothamsted Carbon (RothC) model, may predict the long-term behaviour of soil carbon content and may suggest optimal land use patterns suitable for the achievement of land degradation neutrality as measured in terms of the SOC indicator. In this paper, we compared continuous and discrete versions of the RothC model, especially to achieve long-term solutions. The original discrete formulation of the RothC model was then compared with a novel non-standard integrator that represents an alternative to the exponential Rosenbrock\u2013Euler approach in the literature.

        "Comment": "Under the increase in atmospheric CO2 during the last century, variable increases in the intrinsic water-use efficiency ( Wi), i.e., the ratio between carbon assimilation rate ( A) and stomatal conductance ( gs), of C 3 vegetation have been observed. Here, we ask if long-term nutrient status and especially nitrogen supply have an effect on the CO2 response of Wi in a temperate seminatural C 3 grassland. This analysis draws on the long-term trends (1915-2009) in Wi, derived from carbon isotope analysis, of archived hay and herbage from the Park Grass Experiment at Rothamsted (South-East England). Plant samples came from five fertilizer treatments, each with different annual nitrogen (N; 0, 48 or 96 kg ha -1), phosphorus (P; 0 or 35 kg ha -1) and potassium (K; 0 or 225 kg ha-1) applications, with lime as required to maintain soil pH near 7. Carbon isotope discrimination ( 13Delta) increased significantly ( P<0.001) on the Control (0.9 per mil per 100 ppm CO2 increase). This trend differed significantly ( P<0.01) from those observed on the fertilized treatments ( PK only: 0.4 per mil per 100 ppm CO2 increase, P<0.001; Low N only, Low N+ PK, High N+ PK: no significant increase). The 13&Delta; trends on fertilized treatments did not differ significantly from each other. However, N status, assessed as N fertilizer supply plus an estimate of biologically fixed N, was negatively related ( r2=0.88; P<0.02) to the trend for 13&Delta; against CO2. Other indices of N status exhibited similar relationships. Accordingly, the increase in Wi at High N+ PK was twice that of the Control (+28% resp. +13% relative to 1915). In addition, the CO2 responsiveness of 13&Delta; was related to the grass content of the plant community. This may have been due to the greater CO2 responsiveness of gs in grasses relative to forbs. Thus, the greater CO2 response of grass-rich fertilized swards may be related to effects of nutrient supply on botanical composition.",

        "Comment": "Productivity and N concentration of wheat cv. Brimstone (modern) and Square Head's Master (old) were compared in field experiments at Rothamsted Experimental Station, UK in 1988-90. The cultivars were supplied with 0-288 kg N/ha and basal dressings of P, K and Mg (except for one plot). Brimstone had a 52% higher grain yield than Square Head's Master. Both absolutely and proportionately, Brimstone produced more grain at the higher levels of N application than did Square Head's Master. Lodging did not appear to reduce the yield of Square Head's Master. N application greatly increased shoot biomass at maturity, but at any given level of N application, the biomass of the 2 cultivars was virtually identical. Because of the greater harvest index of Brimstone, and despite the lower N concentration in its grain, its grain from unit land area contained more N than did that of Square Head's Master. Accordingly, the apparent recovery of N by the grain of Brimstone was greater than that of Square Head's Master. It was calculated that less land and fertilizer N would be needed to produce a tonne of grain with Brimstone than with Square Head's Master. However, the apparent loss of fertilizer N in intensive wheat growing was estimated to be greater at high than at low levels of application, whether or not straw was incorporated into the soil.",

Here, we obtain traditional most probable number estimates (MPN) of Rhizobium abundance in soil as a form of sample validation. Our work shows that in the Highfield experiment at Rothamsted, which has three contrasting conditions (>50years continual bare fallow, wheat and grassland), MPN based on host plant nodulation assays corroborate metagenomic and metatranscriptomic estimates for Rhizobium leguminosarum sv. trifolii abundance. This validation is important to legitimize soil metagenomics and metatranscriptomics for the study of complex relationships between gene function and phylogeny. Significance and Impact of the StudyThis study has demonstrated for the first time a functional assay validation of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets by utilizing the clover and Rhizobium leguminosarum sv. trifolii mutualism. The results show that the Most Probable Number results corroborate the results of the omics approaches and gives confidence to the study of other biological systems where such a cross-check is not available.",

        "Comment": "Organic matter amendments appear to increase yield, but need to be sustained, as yield decreases when amendments cease. Here we mathematically devise optimal strategies for organic matter applications that take account of how quickly, in years of application, yields build up with amendments and how long these benefits persist. The empirical idea of a nutrient response curve is used and extended to include more than a single nutrient input as well as the effect of yield-enhancing factors such as organic matter that endure for more than one year. Nonlinear regression is used for the selection and the parameter identification for a reciprocal response curve working with a dataset from Rothamsted\u2019s Woburn organic manuring long term experiment. Such a response curve is then treated analytically to develop economically optimum applications over a period of time. A simple static case is developed first and is shown to be equivalent to the well-known break-even ratio (BER) used in nitrogen fertiliser guidance by the Agricultural and Horticultural Development Board in the UK. The mathematical technique of optimal control is then employed to deduce dynamic strategies where the application of an amendment may change from year to year and for different time frames. Because this empirical modelling methodology can appear complex, we infer a rule-of-thumb for an equilibrium level of yield-enhancement rather like the equilibrium level of organic carbon that builds up over several years. This yield-enhancing power of organic matter is somewhat variable and probably does not persist in soil for as long as the organic matter from which it derives. It appears beneficial to apply amendments at a constant rate for much of the time-frame of interest but to begin with a large application to raise the fertility to the yield-enhancement equilibrium. After a transition year with reduced amendments, applications of organic matter are stopped for the final five years with the example amendment studied, farmyard manure. These conclusions depend on the persistence of the yield-enhancing power of organic matter in soil associated with the soil organic carbon kinetics.",

        "Comment": "Increasing the inputs of nutrients has played a major role in increasing the supply of food to a continually growing world population. However, focusing attention on the most important nutrients, such as nitrogen (N), has in some cases led to nutrient imbalances, some excess applications especially of N, inefficient use and large losses to the environment with impacts on air and water quality, biodiversity and human health. In contrast, food exports from the developing to the developed world are depleting soils of nutrients in some countries. Better management of all essential nutrients is required that delivers sustainable agriculture and maintains the necessary increases in food production while minimizing waste, economic loss and environmental impacts. More extensive production systems typified by 'organic farming' may prove to be sustainable. However, for most of the developed world, and in the developing world where an ever-growing population demands more food, it will be essential to increase the efficiency of nutrient use in conventional systems. Nutrient management on farms is under the control of the land manger, the most effective of whom will already use various decision supports for calculating rates of application to achieve various production targets. Increasingly, land managers will need to conform to good practice to achieve production targets and to conform to environmental targets as well.",

The total amount of nitrogen relative to soil organic carbon increased down the profile with most of the recognizable nitrogen-containing compounds in the leaf litter and humic horizon being either amino acid or amino sugar derived. In contrast, a significant proportion of the organic nitrogen moieties in the mineral horizon appeared to contain macromolecular-bound nitrogen which is believed to represent the so-called 'unknown' soil organic nitrogen and is not obviously related to known biomolecules. The increase in total amino acids in the humic and mineral horizons indicated contributions from sources other than the leaf litter. The increase in organic nitrogen-containing moieties, most probably amino acid derived, accounted for the less depleted delta(13)C values observed in the mineral soil horizon.",

Wax esters were of low abundance and too strongly affected by degradation and transesterification processes to identify a dominant input whilst the composition of soil n-alkanols was largely determined by FYM with a minor pedogenic input. n-Alkanoic acids increased in overall abundance in soils with a continual FYM input and showed appreciable degradation in soils receiving no manure.

        "Comment": "Total lipid extracts and solvent insoluble organic matter in soils from the Park Grass Experiment at Rothamsted Experimental Station, Harpenden, U.K. were studied to determine the effect of pH on the preservation/degradation of plant derived biomolecules. Analyses involved high temperature-gas chromatography (HT-GC), HT-GC\u2013mass spectrometry (HT-GC\u2013MS), GC combustion\u2013isotope ratio MS (GCC\u2013IRMS) and flash pyrolysis\u2013GC (Py\u2013GC) and Py\u2013GC\u2013MS. The plots selected for study have pH values ranging from 3.7 to 7.3, with acidic soils exhibiting two distinct horizons (i.e. humic rich top layer and mineral soil). The total lipid extracts of the soil samples with low pH exhibited higher relative abundances of long-chain (>C20) organic acids believed to be derived largely from oxidation of plant lipids. The vegetation signature in the low molecular weight fraction is only retained in the humic rich top layer. The signal in the mineral layer is believed to derive primarily from previous vegetation. Compound specific stable carbon isotope (?13C) measurements of long-chain n-alkanols are considered to reflect differences in the rate of incorporation of plant lipids into the humic top layer related to the grass species dominating the standing vegetation. In the soil samples of low pH, lignin contributes to the high molecular weight fraction of the humic layer. In contrast, the mineral layer of the same soil shows little evidence of intact lignin, but is instead dominated by amino acid. ",

The lipid content of the primary organic inputs for each soil were also analysed in order to assess the early diagenetic fate of the various compound classes present. Soil pH was observed to either directly or indirectly, have a significant effect on lipids with a relative increase in abundance of n-alkanes at higher pH (7.31) and a large relative increase in n-alkanoic and omega-hydroxy acids at low pH (3.74). Triacylglycerols exhibited severe losses irrespective of pH. In an arable soil, n-alkanoic acids showed a temporal decrease in concentration whilst levels of n-alkanols remained static, the difference was ascribed to a more rapid turnover and possible leachate migration of the n-alkanoic acids. The phytosterol, sitosterol, was observed to rapidly diminish in soils possibly as a result of assimilation by soil dwelling invertebrates. Analysis of 5 beta-stigmastanol (a faecal biomarker) showed that it remained at levels indicative of manuring even after 113 years. Furthermore, analysis of 5 beta-stanyl esters revealed a manuring signal even more persistent than that exhibited by the free stanols. Knowledge of the biogeochemical cycling of lipids in the soil environment will help facilitate understanding of the processes which underpin carbon cycling in soils. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The distributions of n-alkylcarboxylic acids, omega -hydroxycarboxylic acids and dicarboxylic acids in the grass and the underlying soil have been determined. Short-chain (<C20) n-alkylcarboxylic acids were designated as having derived from both aerial and sub-aerial vegetation. However, longer-chain n-alkylcarboxylic acids were ascribed to suberin as a predominant source. Moreover, omega -hydroxycarboxylic acids and dicarboxylic acids observed in the soil were designated as having predominantly derived from inputs of free, extractable polyesters and suberin intimately associated with plant roots. This study indicates the importance of root material as a predominant source of aliphatic, organic acids in the soil of temperate grassland biomes.",

        "Comment": "Total lipid extracts and insoluble organic matter, i.e. solvent insoluble matter and humic acids, were studied from soil samples taken from the three adjacent plots comprising the Broadbalk Wilderness at Rothamsted Experimental Station, Harpenden, Hertfordshire, U.K. Analyses involved high-temperature gas chromatography (HT-GC) and HT-GC-mass spectrometry (HT-GC-MS) to investigate trimethylsilylated total lipid extracts and Curie-point pyrolysis-GC (PY-GC) and Py-GC-MS to investigate solvent insoluble fractions. The plots were chosen specifically for their different types of vegetation cover. Samples of the vegetation were examined in parallel with the underlying soils in an effort to follow the fate of the major plant components in soil. The application of HT-GC and HT-GC-MS allowed changes in high molecular weight lipids, particularly intact acyl lipids, such as triacylglycerols, wax esters, steryl and triterpenyl esters, to be studied in leaf and soil extracts. The total lipid extracts of the soil samples from the wooded area were dominated by the input from leaf-derived lipids. The lipid extracts of soils from the grazed and stubbed areas were markedly different from those from the wooded area, and reflected the mixed vegetation cover dominated by grass species. In marked contrast, the pyrolysis data from the insoluble organic matter and humic fractions of the soils did not reflect the composition of the lignin comprising the overlying vegetation, but rather showed evidence of amino acid moieties probably present as polypeptides. The absence of the lignin signal is possibly due to rapid diagenetic changes presumed to be influenced by the slightly alkaline pH of the soil. The ability to recover recognizable chemical signals from soil lipids has important implications for archaeological investigations aimed at revealing temporal changes in vegetation cover and/or differences in land use at specific site locations.

        "Comment": "Archived background soils (\"Broadbalk', 1944-1986) and sludge- amended soils (\"Luddington\", 1968-1990), collected from long- term agricultural experiments in the UK, were analyzed for a range of organochlorine (OC) pesticides to establish trends over time. Concentrations typically ranged from 0.1 to 10 ng g of soil (dry weight), with gamma -hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma -HCH), dieldrin, and p,p'-DDE consistently having the highest concentrations. The trends in the Broadbalk background soils are largely consistent with usage patterns, with peak concentrations occurring in the 1960s for DDTs and between the 1960s and the 1980s for the other OCs. In the Luddington control and sludge-amended soils, several of the OCs show a significant decline in concentrations from the late 1960s to 1990, with half-lives ranging from similar to7 years (alpha - HCH) to similar to 25 years (dieldrin). The sludge-amended plot received 125 tonnes of sludge per ha in 1968, which was mixed in to a depth of 15 cm. It appears that the Sludge treatment had little effect on concentrations in the soil, with no significant difference between control soil and sludge-amended soil for most compounds, except for HCB, p,p'-DDE, and dieldrin. Enantiomeric fractions (EFs) of some chiral pesticides (alpha -HCH, cis- and trans-chlordane, and o,p'-DDT) were determined in the Luddington soils. Results reveal that enantioselective degradation of OC pesticides is occurring in these soils for trans-chlordane (TC) and cis-chlordane (CC). However; the depletion over time is not statistically significant, and there is no statistically significant difference between EFs in the control soil and sludge-amended soil. This indicates that enantioselective microbial degradation was not consistent over time and that the addition of sludge to soil did not significantly alter the enantiomeric preference of the microbial community.",

        "Comment": "Spatial scaling is a critical issue in ecology, but how anthropogenic activities like fertilization affect spatial scaling is poorly understood, especially for microbial communities. Here, we determined the effects of long-term fertilization on the spatial scaling of microbial functional diversity and its relationships to plant diversity in the 150-year-old Park Grass Experiment, the oldest continuous grassland experiment in the world. Nested samples were taken from plots with contrasting inorganic fertilization regimes, and community DNAs were analyzed using the GeoChip-based functional gene array. The slopes of microbial gene-area relationships (GARs) and plant species-area relationships (SARs) were estimated in a plot receiving nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) and a control plot without fertilization. Our results indicated that long-term inorganic fertilization significantly increased both microbial GARs and plant SARs. Microbial spatial turnover rates (i.e., z values) were less than 0.1 and were significantly higher in the fertilized plot (0.0583) than in the control plot (0.0449) (P < 0.0001). The z values also varied significantly with different functional genes involved in carbon (C), N, P, and sulfur (S) cycling and with various phylogenetic groups (archaea, bacteria, and fungi). Similarly, the plant SARs increased significantly (P < 0.0001), from 0.225 in the control plot to 0.419 in the fertilized plot. Soil fertilization, plant diversity, and spatial distance had roughly equal contributions in shaping the microbial functional community structure, while soil geochemical variables contributed less. These results indicated that long-term agricultural practice could alter the spatial scaling of microbial biodiversity. IMPORTANCE Determining the spatial scaling of microbial biodiversity and its response to human activities is important but challenging in microbial ecology. Most studies to date are based on different sites that may not be truly comparable or on short-term perturbations, and hence, the results observed could represent transient responses. This study examined the spatial patterns of microbial communities in response to different fertilization regimes at the Rothamsted Research Experimental Station, which has become an invaluable resource for ecologists, environmentalists, and soil scientists. The current study is the first showing that long-term fertilization has dramatic impacts on the spatial scaling of microbial communities. By identifying the spatial patterns in response to long-term fertilization and their underlying mechanisms, this study makes fundamental contributions to predictive understanding of microbial biogeography.",

Average TP and PP exceeded 1 mg L-1 in about half of the 12 plots receiving superphosphate for the 5 measurements taken between December 2000 and April 2001. Ranging between 33.8% and 87.3% of TP, PP was the largest P fraction in drainage waters, with DOP, ranging from 0.5% to 26.2% of TP, being the smallest fraction. Mean proportions of PP, MRP and DOP in TP in drainage waters were 63.4%, 32.5% and 4.1%, respectively. These findings support previous findings that P losses from soil to drainage waters were much larger than previously thought, and could therefore make a significant contribution to eutrophication.",

        "Comment": "Evolution of resistance to drugs and pesticides poses a serious threat to human health and agricultural production. CYP51 encodes the target site of azole fungicides, widely used clinically and in agriculture. Azole resistance can evolve due to point mutations or overexpression of CYP51, and previous studies have shown that fungicide-resistant alleles have arisen by de novo mutation. Paralogs CYP51A and CYP51B are found in filamentous ascomycetes, but CYP51A has been lost from multiple lineages. Here, we show that in the barley pathogen Rhynchosporium commune, re-emergence of CYP51A constitutes a novel mechanism for the evolution of resistance to azoles. Pyrosequencing analysis of historical barley leaf samples from a unique long-term experiment from 1892 to 2008 indicates that the majority of the R. commune population lacked CYP51A until 1985, after which the frequency of CYP51A rapidly increased. Functional analysis demonstrates that CYP51A retains the same substrate as CYP51B, but with different transcriptional regulation. Phylogenetic analyses show that the origin of CYP51A far predates azole use, and newly sequenced Rhynchosporium genomes show CYP51A persisting in the R. commune lineage rather than being regained by horizontal gene transfer; therefore, CYP51A re-emergence provides an example of adaptation to novel compounds by selection from standing genetic variation.

        "Comment": "When N-15 is used to trace the fate of N fertilizer applied in spring to winter wheat crops, some is not recovered in the crop or the soil and has to be presumed lost. In 13 experiments made from 1980 to 1983 on three widely differing soils, these losses ranged from 1 to 35%. We partitioned them between leaching and denitrification by using models to estimate the loss by leaching, taking into account the N absorbed by the crops, and subtracting this loss from the total loss to obtain the apparent percentage loss by denitrification, L(DN). An analysis of variance showed that L(DN) increased significantly with the quantity of N applied, so the study considered L(DN) values for a standard N application of 150 kg ha subsequently. Regressions showed that L(DN) was better related to the wetness of the soil during the 3 weeks after fertilizer application than to the corresponding amount of rain, as would be expected for denitrification. Values of L(DN) could not, however, be satisfactorily related to soil temperature, probably because the range of temperatures was too narrow. The apparent losses by denitrification were, on average, nearly twice as large as those by leaching, but the ratio varied greatly between experiments.",

        "Comment": "Soil pH is often hypothesized to be a major factor regulating organic matter turnover and inorganic nitrogen production in agricultural soils. The aim of this study was to critically test the relationship between soil pH and rates of C and N cycling, and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), in two long-term field experiments in which pH had been manipulated (Rothamsted silty clay loam, pH 3.5-6.8; Woburn sandy loam, pH 3.4-6.3). While alteration of pH for 37 years significantly affected crop production, it had no significant effect on total soil C and N or indigenous mineral N levels. This implies that at steady state, increased organic matter inputs to the soil are balanced by increased outputs of CO2. This is supported by the positive correlation between both plant productivity and intrinsic microbial respiration with soil pH. In addition, soil microbial biomass C and N, and nitrification were also significantly positively correlated with soil pH. Measurements of respiration following addition of urea and amino acids showed a significant decline in CO2 evolution with increasing soil acidity, whilst glucose mineralization showed no response to pH. In conclusion, it appears that changes in soil pH significantly affect soil microbial activity and the rate of soil C and N cycling. The evidence suggests that this response is partially indirect, being primarily linked to pH induced changes in net primary production and the availability of substrates. In addition, enhanced soil acidity may also act directly on the functioning of the microbial community itself. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "Comment": "The fate of phosphorus (P) derived from mineral fertilisers and organic manures, and the effective P balance, have been assessed in three long-term field experiments at Rothamsted (UK), Bad Lauchstaedt (Germany) and Skierniewice (Poland). This paper discusses the plant availability, uptake and overall utilisation of P over the last 30 years, based on soil test P 'availability indices' and crop analyses determined by the standard methods used in each of the three countries. The data suggest that differences in soil type significantly influence the dynamics of P at the three locations, but most significantly between a loess Chernozem at Bad Lauchstaedt with a high organic matter content and the soils at the other two locations which have a low organic matter content. The application of P either as inorganic fertiliser or organic manure had a considerable influence on the availablity, uptake, leaching or fixing of P, but the crop recovery rate of P from mineral fertiliser did not exceed 35% with the smallest recovery (average 18%) occurring in the soil with the highest clay content at Rothamsted. At Bad Lauchstaedt and Rothamsted the most efficient utilisation of P (averages of 47% and 37%, respectively) was from soils treated with farmyard manure (FYM), with the greater quantity of P either leached or fixed (8 and 25 kg ha(-1) y(-1), respectively) occurring in soils treated with superphosphate. At Skierniewice, however, the reverse was true. Overall, the most efficient crop utilisation from mineral P (30% average) was from the loamy sand at Skierniewice. P balances for the three locations show that quantitatively, for the same P input, the amount of P either leached from or fixed in the plough layer of Broadbalk field, Rothamsted, was 2-3 times greater than at Skierniewice and 3-6 times greater than at Bad Lauchstaedt. The results suggest that differences in the soil physico-chemical properties, climate, the availability of other major nutrients, and the form in which P is applied, all influence the effectiveness of P fertilisation and P balance. The investigation highlights the importance of maintaining long-term field experiments and archived soil and crop samples on a world-wide basis for understanding nutrient cycling and fertility dynamics. Most models for the turnover of soil organic matter (SOM) include a compartment that is either considered inert, or has a very slow turnover time (refractory SOM; RSOM), The RSOM content of soils varies markedly between sites, and knowledge of its size and variability are essential for determining whether soils behave as sources or sinks of atmospheric CO2, It has also been suggested that the accurate specification of RSOM pools is essential to modelling studies, and that uncertainty in estimates of the size of RSOM pool could be a major source of error in modelling soil organic C, In this paper, current SOM models are reviewed, and approaches to modelling RSOM and its significance are discussed. Simulations of SOM turnover for the Rothamsted Broadbalk winter wheat experiment using the Rothamsted C model and CENTURY are presented as examples.",

        "Comment": "Insight into the role of phosphorus (P) in soil fertility and crop nutrition at Rothamsted, UK, and its involvement in associated environmental issues, has come from long-term field experiments initially started by J. B. Lawes in 1843 and continued by others, together with experiments on different soils. Results from the 1940s confirmed that residues of P applied in fertilizers and manures build up reserves of P in soil. There is a strong relationship between crop yield and plant-available P (Olsen P), and a critical level of Olsen P can be determined. For soils near the critical level, P-use efficiency is high when the P applied and offtake by the crop is nearly equal. Soil inorganic P is associated with various soil components and is held there with a range of bonding energies so that when no P is applied, the decline in Olsen P follows a smooth curve. We conceptualize inorganic soil P as being in four pools of vastly varying size, availability for uptake, and extractability by reagents used in routine soil analysis, and with reversible transfer of P between pools. For very disparate soils at Rothamsted and in the United States, there is a strong relationship between the change in Olsen P and P removal/input ratios, suggesting an underlying similarity in inorganic P behavior. Maintaining soil near the critical level should optimize yield and the use of the global P resource while minimizing the risk of transfer of large amounts of P to the aquatic environment.",

        "Comment": "Diffuse losses of phosphorus (P) from agricultural land currently make the biggest contribution to the eutrophication of freshwaters in Denmark. Phosphorus leaching, especially in artificially drained soils, is now considered an important process. As the result of P accumulation, the P sorption capacity is declining in agricultural topsoils in Denmark, thus increasing the potential for P movement. Phosphorus leached from topsoils may be prevented from sorption in subsoils, which still have retained a large capacity to bind phosphorus, due to preferential flow processes. Macropores, such as earthworm channels, facilitate the rapid transport of dissolved and particulate phosphorus through soil profiles, limiting the spatial and temporal contact with the bulk soil and hence phosphorus retention. Attempts to build a comprehensive model of phosphorus leaching are still at an initial stage.",

        "Comment": "Total P (TP), total particulate P (TPP), dissolved reactive P (DRP), and dissolved organic P (DOP) were determined in waters from pipe-drains (at 65-cm depth) from the Broadbalk Experiment at Rothamsted. Soils that have received either no P, P in farmyard manure (about 40 kg P ha(-1)) or superphosphate (up to 35 kg P ha(-1)) annually for >150 yr, now contain 0.5 M NaHCO3- extractable P concentrations (Olsen-P) in the plow layer (0- to 23-cm depth) between 5 and 100 mg kg(-1) soil. Our aim was to determine if significant quantities of P could be detected in the drainage water and their relationship to soil P concentrations. On five occasions between October 1992 and January 1994, both TP and DRP from plots receiving superphosphate frequently exceeded 1 mg L(-1) and were high compared with literature data. Ranging between 66 and 86% of TP, DRP was the largest fraction in drainage water. It remained low (<0.15 mg L(-1)) from plots below 60 mg Olsen-P kg(-1). There was then a rapid increase in DRP up to the maximum Olsen- P concentration. A simple linear Split-Line Model described this relationship very well for all drainage events. This implies that up to 60 mg Olsen-P kg(-1) soil (the change point), P was retained strongly in the plow layer. Above this, P losses in the drainage water were much more closely related to Olsen-P than commonly suggested. The mechanisms could either be preferential how or rapid transport of P in forms less susceptible to sorption but finally measured as DRP. The results suggest enhanced P losses through subsurface runoff on heavy soils, once a certain plow layer concentration of Olsen-P is exceeded.",

        "Comment": "Concentrations and annual loadings of molybdate reactive P (MRP) and total (including particulate) P (TP) are reported from field drainage, catchment and erosion experiments in England. Annual losses through field drains and in catchment runoff were 0.035-0.74 kg MRP/ha and 0.35-2.64 kg TP/ha, but those in surface runoff from experimental plots measuring erosion were generally much greater (often > 3 kg MRP/ha and up to 32 kg TP/ha in a wet year). Amounts of TP in drainflow and catchment runoff depended upon factors influencing soil dispersibility, such as particle size distribution and calcium carbonate content. The results to date suggest that P losses in surface runoff and erosion from arable fields to water are best limited by: (a) maximizing crop cover, using minimal cultivation practices and where possible planting crop rows across rather than up and down the slope, (b) avoiding cultivation practices that result in dispersion of soil particles, and (c) avoiding application of P fertilizer to wet soils when rainfall is likely soon after application. Consideration should be given to maintaining field drains below peak efficiency to reduce subsurface P losses.",

        "Comment": "Changes in understanding the behavior of soil and fertilizer phosphorus (P) during the last 150 years are presented and recent concepts have been linked with agronomic data to produce a model that considers four pools of inorganic soil P related to their plant availability and extractability by chemical extractants. The stronger the bonding of phosphate ions to soil components, the lower the plant availability. P-use efficiency in agriculture is related to soils reaching and being maintained at a critical level of readily plant-available P, and factors affecting the critical level are discussed. Efficiency can be assessed by the direct, difference, and balance methods. The latter, calculated as the P output/input ratio, shows that P-use efficiency can exceed 80-90%. Combined data from controlled experiments in England and derived \"statewide\" aggregate information in the United States relating output/input ratios to changes in plant-available P could best be described by a single, simple function, making a powerful and convincing statement suggesting that there is an underlying \"simple rule\" for the behavior of plant-available inorganic soil P that is related to the four-pool concept discussed.",

        "Comment": "Populations of A. odoratum were collected from contrasting plots of the Park Grass Experiment, Rothamsted, grown under identical conditions for 6-18 months, and then grown in sand-culture experiments. Ca concentration in the culture solution affected the dry weight yield of populations from limed plots more than that of populations from unlimed plots. The response of each population to plots more than that of each population to Ca was closely correlated with the soil pH of its source plot (r = 0.90), and with the soil Ca status of its source plot (r = 0.86); the differences evolved within 50 years and over distances of <30 m. The concentration of Ca and P in the shoots of populations from unlimed plots was greater than that in populations from limed plots but the concentration of K, Mg and Na was similar in all populations. Total Ca uptake per plant was 30% greater among populations from unlimed plots than those from limed plots, when 2 mgCa/l was supplied, but was similar in both population types when 54 or 162 mgCa/l was supplied. At given low concentrations of Ca in the shoot, populations from unlimed plots produced relatively more DM than those from limed plots. Differences between Park Grass populations in response to Ca were as great as those between natural populations of A. odoratum or between ecologically contrasting grass species collected from an equivalent range of soils. The differences between populations of A. odoratum in response to Ca and to other soil factors appeared to be large enough to account for the wide edaphic distribution of A. odoratum both on the Park Grass experiment and at large.",

The response of each population to Al was closely correlated (r = 0.95) with the soil pH of its source site. The differences in response to Al between populations of A. odoratum collected from the Park Grass Experiment, which have evolved within 65 years, and over distances of <30 m, were as large as the differences between natural populations from equivalent soil types. The response of each population to Al, measured in terms of root elongation of individual tillers, when grown for 6 or 9 days in complete culture solution with or without added P, was closely correlated (r = 0.96) with the response to Al measured in terms of DM yield, when grown for 5 months in complete culture solution in sand culture. Response to Al, measured in terms of root elongation in calcium nitrate solution, was not significantly correlated (r = 0.38) with response to Al measured in terms of DM yield in sand culture. It was concluded that the root elongation technique, using complete culture solution, was a rapid and satisfactory method of evaluating response to Al in A. odoratum, but that results obtained using calcium nitrate solution were not a reliable measure of Al response in this species.",

In contrast, populations from calcareous soils, not fertilized with K, responded to K up to the highest level used, 81 mg K l-1. Populations from unlimed plots of the Park Grass Experiment, fertilized with K, responded more than all other populations up to 81 mg K 1-1. One population, collected from a limed soil also fertilized with K, responded least to K. If this latter population was disregarded, there was a close correlation (r=0.92) between response to K, over the range 1-81 mg K 1-1, and the extractable K content of the native soil of each population. Differences between populations in shoot concentrations of K were not correlated with yield response to K, but populations from limed soils generally achieved maximum yield at lower shoot K concentrations than did those from unlimed soils. The yield of all populations was little affected by the Mg concentration applied and populations did not differ in response to Mg. The abundance of A. odoratum is not affected by Mg supply on the Park Grass Experiment and it is concluded that no population differentiation has occurred in response to this nutrient.",

        "Comment": "The amounts of soil microbial biomass in metal-contaminated (high-metal) soils of the Woburn Market Garden Experiment in the U.K. are now about half those in similar uncontaminated (low-metal) soils from the same experiment. The metal-contamination was caused by applications of metal-rich sewage-sludge which ceased about 30 yr ago. Soil metal concentrations in the high-metal soils are now at, or a little above, current European Community limits. This work was designed to see if heavy metals decreased soil microbial biomass by decreasing the input of plant material to the soil or if the synthesis of microbial biomass is less efficient in the presence of heavy metals. Either or both of these mechanisms could explain the effects of heavy metals on microbial biomass in the Woburn experiment. Sunflower (Helianthus annus L., cultivar Sunbred 246) seedlings were grown for 31 days under controlled conditions (12 h day at 20-degrees-C, 12 h night at 17-degrees-C) in a low-metal or a high-metal soil from the Woburn experiment. From days 2 1. to 31 of growth the plants were supplied with C-14-labelled CO2 on alternate days. The final dry matter yield (shoots plus roots) of the plants grown on the low-metal soil was about 30% greater than that of the plants grown on the high-metal soil. The distribution of total C and C-14-labelled C between the various plant and soil compartments viz. plant shoots, roots, soil microbial biomass and bulk soil, were measured 2 days after the final (CO2)-C-14 labelling. The percentage distribution of C-14 within shoots, roots, soil microbial biomass and bulk soil was quite similar in both soils. Plant-derived C-14-labelled organic C inputs into the high-metal soil were about 20% less than in the low-metal soil. About 35% less of this C-14-labelled C was in the microbial biomass in the high-metal soil than the low-metal soil at harvest. The plants caused an increase in total biomass C of about 22 and 42-mu-g C g-1 soil respectively in the high-metal and low-metal soil at harvest, about half of which was C-14-labelled in both cases. These increases in biomass were thus in the same ratio as those of the biomass in high-metal and low-metal soils taken directly from the field. These results suggest that both mechanisms (i.e. decreased inputs of C from plants to the soil and decreased efficiency of conversion of this C into new biomass C) operate in causing smaller biomasses in metal-contaminated soils of the Woburn experiment. The latter mechanism would appear more important than the former.",

        "Comment": "Increasing fertilizer costs have prompted farmers to ask whether soils could be maintained at lower levels of plant-available phosphorus (Olsen P) than currently recommended without losing yield. To help answer this question, we assessed the response to Olsen P by spring barley grown from 1986 to 1991, followed by winter wheat from 1992 to 2008, on a silty clay loam soil. Each year the curve relating grain yield to Olsen P was fitted statistically to determine the asymptotic yield and the Olsen P associated with 98% of that yield, that is, the critical level of Olsen P. The variance accounted for by the relationship ranged between 83 and 97% in all but two years, suggesting that the availability of soil P was the major soil factor affecting yield and that Olsen P was a reliable measure of plantavailable P in soil. Asymptotic annual yield of spring barley ranged from 2.34 to 7.12 t ? ha and of winter wheat from 3.87 to 10.36 t ? ha. In part, this range in yields was because of changes in the cultivar grown while the range of yields for any one cultivar was probably due to differences in weather, principally rainfall, between years. Critical Olsen P ranged from 7 to 18 mg? kg for both cereal crops (with one outlier at 26 mg? kg for winter wheat) most probably due to seedbed and soil structure conditions affecting root growth, and thus acquisition of available soil P, and the way these soil factors were affected by weather. Thus, a general recommendation for cereals grown on this silty clay loam, which is comparatively easy to cultivate, would be to maintain Olsen P at about 20 mg? kg in the plough layer to minimize the risk of losing yield in some years. This value, 20 mg? kg, equivalent to 20 mg? L, is the midpoint of P Index 2, the recommended P Index given in the Fertiliser Manual (RB209) (Defra 2010) for soils growing arable crops and grass in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.",

        "Comment": "The increasing cost of fertilizer has prompted farmers to ask whether soils could be maintained at lower levels of plant-available phosphorus (Olsen P) than currently recommended, without limiting yield. To help answer this question, critical levels of Olsen P have been determined for spring barley, winter wheat, potatoes and sugar beet grown on a sandy clay loam and a poorly structured heavy textured silty clay loam. On each soil, there were plots with a range of well-established levels of Olsen P and, in one experiment, two levels of soil organic matter (SOM). For each crop and each year, the response curve relating yield to Olsen P   was fitted statistically to determine the asymptotic yield and the Olsen P associated with 98% of that yield, that is, the critical Olsen  P. Maximum yield of all four crops varied greatly from year to year, in part due to applied nitrogen (N) where it was tested, and in part to seasonal variation in weather, mainly rainfall. The wide range in critical Olsen P, from 8 to 36 mg? kg, between years was most probably as a result of differences in soil conditions that affected root growth and thus acquisition of available soil phosphorus (P). Generally, a larger asymptotic yield was not necessarily associated with a larger critical Olsen P. Spring barley and winter wheat given little N required more Olsen P, 20\u201334 mg? kg, to achieve the asymptotic yield, compared to 10\u201317 mg? kg where ample N was given; presumably, more roots were needed to search the soil for the smaller amounts of available N and root growth is affected by the amount of plant-available soil P. In a field experiment on one soil type, soil with little SOM required 2\u20133.5 times more Olsen P to produce the same yield as that on soil with more organic matter. Soil organic matter most probably improved soil structure and hence the ability of roots to grow and search for nutrients in field conditions because when these soils were cropped with ryegrass in controlled conditions in the glasshouse, the yields of grass were independent of SOM and there was the same critical Olsen P for both soils. Overall, the data confirm that, for these soil types, the current recommendations for Olsen P for arable crops in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are appropriate.",

In this study, the effects of a century-long fertilization treatment (> 150 years) on the networks between plants and soil microbial functional communities, detected by GeoChip, in grassland were determined in the Park Grass Experiment at Rothamsted Research, UK. Our results showed that plants and soil microbes have a consistent response to long-term fertilization-both richness and diversity of plants and soil microbes are significantly decreased, as well as microbial functional genes involved in soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling. The network-based analyses showed that long-term fertilization decreased the complexity of networks between plant and microbial functional communities in terms of node numbers, connectivity, network density and the clustering coefficient. Similarly, within the soil microbial community, the strength of microbial associations was also weakened in response to long-term fertilization. Mantel path analysis showed that soil C and N contents were the main factors affecting the network between plants and microbes. Our results indicate that century-long fertilization weakens the plant-microbe networks, which is important in improving our understanding of grassland ecosystem functions and stability under long-term agriculture management.",

        "Comment": "Polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) have been analyzed in archived soil from the U.K. to investigate historical trends. Samples were obtained from the Broadbalk experiment plots (1944-1986) and Luddington experiment station (1968-1990). Luddington samples also include a set of soils that received a one-time sludge treatment in 1968, and duplicate samples of this archived sludge were also analyzed. Peak residues of Sigma PCN (sum of all PCN congeners ;quantified) were similar to 9000 pg g(-1) dry weight in 1956, declining to similar to 300 pg g(- 1) in contemporary soils. The one-time sludge application resulted in elevated soil residues that were 1.5-6 times higher than the control plot over the time series. This increase is consistent with the known application rate and the amount of Sigma PCN in the applied sludge (similar to 250 000 pg g(-1) dry wt). Half-lives for the Luddington control soil and the sludge-amended soil for the period 1972-1990 were 5.3 and 9.9 years, respectively. Investigation of time trends revealed differences between homologue groups with the higher molecular weight congeners peaking earlier in the time series (pre-1950) and the lower molecular weight congeners peaking later, ca. 1970. Time trends of individual congeners were investigated in terms of their relative mass percent contribution to the sum of their homologue group. Significant (p < 0.05) increasing trends were observed for several congeners associated with combustion sources (CN-29, -51, -52 60, -54, and -66 67) suggesting that combustion related sources are more important now than they were in the past. However, no decreasing trend was observed for congeners that were thought to be susceptible to degradation by photolysis suggesting that this may not be a key elimination pathway of PCNs in the environment. A simple calculation of the fugacity status of PCNs in air and soil showed that the tri-CNs are exhibiting net outgassing, while the penta-CNs are still being deposited to soil. Interestingly, the penta-CNs associated with combustion show the largest gradient for air- to-soll transfer, supporting the notion that combustion sources are important contributors to contemporary air burdens of these congeners.",

Validated midden counts and DNA analyses were used to estimate L. terrestris populations and check species identity (>98% match, n = 10). Population estimates ranged between 0 and 13 L. terrestris middens per m(2) on conventionally (inorganic fertiliser only) managed plots. Surface wheat straw applications (p <= 0.05) or wastes mixed with barley straw (p <= 0.05) enhanced L. terrestris midden abundances. However, these were very low at < 4.6 L. terrestris middens per m(2) and a population collapse was recorded under oat cropping. We found a residual population ranging between 0.1-3.6 L. terrestris middens per m(2) on the long running field trials. Further investigations are needed to identify if L. terrestris is functionally extinct at these densities. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

        "Comment": "Population dynamics of the biennial plant <i>Tragopogon pratensis</i> have been monitored in the Park Grass Experiment at Rothamsted Research, Harpenden, UK, over many years. Observations of diseased <i>T. pratensis</i>, systemically infected by the autoecious demicyclic rust <i>Puccinia hysterium</i>, were made over the period 1995\u20132008, and confirmed an outbreak pattern of dynamics, characterised by an increase to a relatively high incidence followed by a reduction to low almost indiscernible levels. An epidemiological model was developed taking into account the biennial habit of the host plant, and the systemic nature of infection during the winter period, and the partial sterilisation of infected second year plants. Seedling emergence rate and natural mortality between seasons and within season were key parameters affecting host performance. The transmission rate between infected second year plants and susceptible first year seedlings, and the probability that the fungus would survive the winter systemically as mycelium producing aecia and telia on emerging second year plants, were key parameters associated with pathogenicity. Furthermore the possibility of pathogen-induced additional mortality was modelled. The model predicted that outbreak dynamics of <i>T. pratensis </i> would occur with high pathogenicity and medium or high host performance. In the former case the population dynamics would be cyclical with, in some cases, infected plants going to extinction. In the latter case both host and pathogen would go to extinction. The model predicted that the two pathogenicity parameters were critical in determining whether the pathogen would invade a healthy population; whereas pathogen-induced mortality had little influence, a result also obtained in some limited potted plant experiments. Fitting the model to the field data indicated that there was little or no density-dependence in seedling emergence rate, and again that pathogen-induced mortality played little role in the observed population dynamics.",

        "Comment": "A major challenge in ecology is to understand how populations are affected by increased climate variability. Here, we assessed the effects of observed climate variability on different organismal groups (amphibians, insects, mammals, herbaceous plants and reptiles) by estimating the extent to which interannual variation in the annual population growth rates (CV?) and the absolute value of the long-term population growth rate (|log ?|) were associated with short-term climate variability. We used empirical data (? 20 consecutive years of annual abundances) from 59 wild populations in the Northern Hemisphere, and quantified variabilities in population growth rates and climatic conditions (temperature and precipitation in active and inactive seasons) calculated over four- and eight-year sliding time windows. We observed a positive relationship between the variability of growth rate (CV?) and the variability of temperature in the active season at the shorter timescale only. Moreover, |log ?| was positively associated with the variability of precipitation in the inactive season at both timescales. Otherwise, the direction of the relationships between population dynamics and climate variability (if any) depended largely on the season and organismal group in question. Both CV? and |log ?| correlated negatively with species' lifespan, indicating general differences in population dynamics between short-lived and long-lived species that were not related to climate variability. Our results suggest that although temporal variation in population growth rates and the magnitude of long-term population growth rates are partially associated with short-term interannual climate variability, demographic responses to climate fluctuations might still be population-specific rather than specific to given organismal groups, and driven by other factors than the observed climate variability.",

        "Comment": "There is conflicting evidence, and therefore continuing concern, as to whether metals in sewage sludge are deleterious to soil microbial processes and long-term agricultural productivity. Nine field experiments with sewage sludge cakes, three with metal-amended liquid sludges and three with inorganic metal salts were set up across Britain in 1994 to give individual metal dose-response treatments to try to answer this question. This study reports on the effects of Zn, Cu and Cd on the population size of <i>Rhizobium leguminosarum</I> biovar <i>trifolii</i>, a nitrogen fixing symbiont of white clover (<i>Trifolium repens</i>), in soils from these experiments over 11 years. Significant (P < 0.05) reductions in indigenous rhizobial numbers occurred on the Zn metal dose-response treatments at eight of the sludge cake sites in 2005, but few consistent effects were evident on the Cu or Cd metal dose-response treatments during the 11-year monitoring period. The soil total Zn concentrations where effects occurred were near to the UK statutory limit of 300 mg kg(-1) for soils receiving sewage sludge. No significant reductions occurred in any treatments on the metal-amended liquid sludge or inorganic metal salt experiments in which the metals would be expected to be in a more bioavailable form, even after 11 years. The effects in the sludge cake experiments were related, consistently with soil total Zn, with no recovery to date. The reductions in clover rhizobial numbers in the sludge cake experiments were due to Zn effects on free-living rhizobia in the soil, with gradual die-off over a long time with increasing soil total Zn concentrations. Currently, no consistent adverse effects on rhizobia have been seen at the UK limits for Cu and Cd of 135 and 3 mg kg-1, respectively. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The plots, from two sections of Broadbalk field, Rothamsted, either had the straw removed, or chopped and incorporated into the soil after every harvest since 1986; the plots also bad different fertilizer treatments. Most species were more abundant in July than in February or April. Estimated propagule numbers of F. culmorum, the only cereal pathogen found frequently, were less than in a survey of the same plots in 1964. It occurred in greatest numbers in plots treated with farmyard manure and, in July, with the largest inorganic nitrogen applications. F. oxysporum and F. solani, non-pathogenic on cereals, were mast frequent in plots treated with phosphorus, potassium and magnesium but without added nitrogen. Other non-pathogenic species, of which the most abundant was F. merismoides, showed no consistent response to any of the fertilizer treatments. The method of straw disposal had no consistent effects. The results are discussed in relation to perceived changes in fusarium disease in the U.K. and changing cereal husbandry practices.",

        "Comment": "This study quantitatively assesses the fate of K derived from mineral fertilizers and organic manures and the effective K balance in three long-term field experiments at Rothamsted (UK), Bad Lauchstaedt (Germany) and Skierniewice (Poland). Plant availability, uptake and the overall utilization of K over the last 30 years (1965-1996) are discussed and related to soil K Availability Indices determined by the standard methods used in each of the three countries. In addition, to provide a standard comparison of the three sites, Exchangeable K (1 M NH4OAc) and Non-exchangeable K (K extracted by boiling with 1 M HNO3) were measured on one recent (1995) set of soil samples. Plant availability and utilization of K was partly related to clay content, but more closely to the cation exchange surfaces associated with both mineral and organic constituents and also, at Rothamsted, to the capacity of clay minerals to fix K. The recovery rate of K from mineral fertilizer by crops did not exceed 62%. Fertilizers were least effective in the most strongly K fixing soil at Rothamsted (44% maximum) and most effective in the soil with the highest cation exchange capacity (CEC) at Bad Lauchstaedt (62%), where the greater quantity of exchange sites appear to be associated with humic material. Recoveries of K from farmyard manure (FYM) varied from 22-117% (values of >100% indicating subsoil uptake or the release of reserves). Deficiencies of N, P and Mg in some treatments decreased the effectiveness of applied K and may have caused increased leaching of K from the plough layer. FYM was generally more effective than mineral fertilizer where mineral N and P were not applied because these nutrients were effectively supplied in the manure. But the effectiveness of mineral K fertilizer decreased when applied in combination with FYM because FYM was the preferred source of K. Where FYM application increased the CEC of soils, this also improved K utilization but only where K was not extensively leached or fixed.",

        "Comment": "Potassium (K) is an essential nutrient for plants and animals, including humans for whom it presents no hazards to their health. Its use in agricultural production is well established and using it has no adverse environmental impact. There are large reserves of high quality K-containing deposits suitable for exploitation so there should be no limitation (other than financial) on its use. There are issues about categorising soil in terms of crop response to plant-available soil K and applied K fertiliser. This review aims to link the behaviour of K in soil with the agronomic response of crops to K. Potassium in soils and plants exists as a positively charged ion (K+). Conceptually, soil K can be considered to exist in four pools related to its availability for uptake by plant roots. Soil solution K is immediately available for uptake, exchangeable K (Kex, readily available), fixed K (slowly/less readily available, mainly residues of past K applications) and lattice/matrix K (an integral part of the clay mineral and very slowly available). Fixed and lattice K are not determined separately and are often referred to as non-exchangeable K (Knex). Analytically there are no issues with determining Kex but measuring Knex and lattice/matrix K is not straightforward. Reversible transfer of K between the soil solution, Kex and Knex, and establishing an equilibrium between the amount of K in these pools could explain issues about the reliability of Kex for categorising plant-available soil K. Improving the prediction of crop response to soil and fertiliser K will require a better knowledge of the amount of both Kex and Knex and the amount and rate of transfer of K between these two pools of soil K. Potassium has two roles in the functioning of plant cells. Small, but essential amounts of K are required for biochemical functions involved in fundamental metabolic processes. Larger amounts of K are needed for the biophysical function of maintaining the water content of plant cells and hence the turgor (rigidity) of each cell and the upright stance of the plant essential for optimum light interception and production of sugars. The plant responds to applied nitrogen (N) both by increasing cell number and cell size so that the plant contains more water and thus more K is needed to maintain turgor. The agronomic responses to N and K derive from the physiologically interacting effect of N and K on tissue hydration and consequential osmotic adjustments in shoot tissues. To ensure crops use applied N efficiently and effectively to produce optimum yields there must be sufficient K accessible to the roots throughout active growth, for which a better measure of the ability of the soil to supply K during this period is essential.

        "Comment": "Potassium?calcium exchange equilibria in, and the kinetics of K release from, soil from the Nil and PK treatments of the Saxmundham Experiment, Rotation 1, and the Ga, Ca + K and K saturated panicle size fractions of the soils were investigated. The free energy and enthalpy ot exchange showed K preference in all the solids. Selectivity for K decreased with increasing particle size and pre?treatment with K salts. A comparison of the \u2018differential enthalpy of exchange: per cent K saturation\u2019 relationship for the whole soil with those of the particle size fractions suggests that soil dispersion during particle size separation also decreased K selectivity significantly. When related to the mineralogical composition of the soil, the differential enthalpy data suggest that maximum K. selectivity is associated with a vermiculite/smectite component of inter?stratified minerals in the soil. Isotopic exchange using 4sCa on the decalcified solids showed a measurable rate of exchange for the Ca forms of the <0.2 and 0.2\u20132 /?m fractions. This is attributed to traces of blocking materials (CaCO3 or hydroxy?aluminium polymers), which are removed or rendered porous during treatment with dilute KCl solution, so that isotopic exchange with Ca is then much more rapid. The kinetics of K extraction with a Ca saturated resin, interpreted on the basis of a three?compartment model, suggest that sorbed K and K released by \u2018fast\u2019 and slow  processes, representing sites of low and high K selectivity, were associated with minera?logically distinct phases in the various particle size fractions.",

        "Comment": "An exponential decline was fitted to measured losses of organic nitrogen from grass soils during the 25 years after ploughing. The experiments were carried out on soils of the Romney and Blacktoft series from the Holland district of Lincolnshire. The fitted line estimated that half of the decline took place in the first 5.5 years and 90% in 18 years. Almost 4 t N ha-1 from soil organic matter were lost from the top 0-25 cm of soil. Losses calculated from the fitted equation were then imposed upon known rates of ploughing of grass throughout England and Wales so that the potential contribution of ploughed grass to nitrate leaching during the last 50 years could be estimated. By the end of the Second World War, ploughed grass could have increased the concentration of nitrate in draining water by more than 40 mg NO3-N 1(-1) in parts of Lincolnshire, the Midlands and East Anglia. In 1972, after another period of increased ploughing, there was a further increase of 15 mg N 1(-1). Water draining from a field of ploughed grass could contain up to 450 mg N 1(-1) in the first season after ploughing. A calculation was made of the area of land that may safely be ploughed out of pasture each year if the EC limit of 11.3 mg N 1(-1) is not to be exceeded in water draining from each of the counties of England and Wales. In parts of the Midlands and East Anglia, the nitrate from ploughed grass (representing less than 0.1 % of the land area) could currently be responsible for more than half of the loading towards the EC limit.",

        "Comment": "One of the main options for carbon mitigation identified by the IPCC is the sequestration of carbon in soils. In this paper we use statistical relationships derived from European long-term experiments to explore the potential for carbon sequestration in soils in the European Union. We examine five scenarios, namely (a) the amendment of arable soils with animal manure, (b) the amendment of arable soils with sewage sludge, (c) the incorporation of cereal straw into the soils in which it was grown, (d) the afforestation of surplus arable land through natural woodland regeneration, and (e) extensification of agriculture through ley-arable farming. Our calculations suggest only limited potential to increase soil carbon stocks over the next century by addition of animal manure, sewage sludge or straw (< 15 Tg C y(-1)), but greater potential through extensification of agriculture (approximate to 40 Tg C y(-1)) or through the afforestation of surplus arable land (approximate to 50 Tg C y(-1)). We estimate that extensification could increase the total soil carbon stock of the European Union by 17%. Afforestation of 30% of present arable land would increase soil carbon stocks by about 8% over a century and would substitute up to 30 Tg C y(-1) of fossil fuel carbon if the wood were used as biofuel. However, even the afforestation scenario, with the greatest potential for carbon mitigation, can sequester only 0.8% of annual global anthropogenic CO2-carbon. Our figures suggest that, although efforts in temperate agriculture can contribute to global carbon mitigation, the potential is small compared to that available through reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions by halting tropical and sub-tropical deforestation or by reducing fossil fuel burning.",

The potential yield of current crops (interception of 0.46 of annual incident PAR; RUE 2.7?g?MJ?1 dry matter above ground, intercepted PAR; harvest index 0.5) was 12\u201314?t?ha?1 for annual solar radiation 3300\u20133800?MJ?m?2 which is typical across wheat-growing regions of the United Kingdom. Many combinations of increases in interception (especially retention of green leaves into August and September), RUE and harvest index would achieve potential yields of 20?t?ha?1 in sunny locations or sunny years with annual solar radiation of 3800?MJ?m?2 or above. Advancing growth duration by one month reduced yields because there was little radiation to be intercepted in March and much to be missed in July and August. If duration was advanced one month and extended by one month of maximum interception then yields were increased by around 16%. From the relationships among yield, nitrogen concentrations of grain and straw, and nitrogen supply from soil and fertilizer, yields of 20?t?ha?1 would require fertilizer application of 450\u2013680?kg?N?ha?1 for breadmaking wheat (13% protein) and 350\u2013580?kg?N?ha?1 for feed wheat (11% protein), with soil supply 100\u2013200?kg?N?ha?1 and harvest index 0.5\u20130.6. If nitrogen application was restricted to the N-max limit for Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (440\u2013500?kg?N?ha?1) then 20?t?ha?1 was achievable only with soil supply well above 100?kg?N?ha?1. Potential yield of wheat of 20?t?ha?1 is possible in the United Kingdom from new cultivars with improved interception of radiation, RUE and harvest index (e.g. by 17%, 32% and 18%, respectively). Improved RUE can be exploited if optimum water and nutrients are maintained throughout crop duration. Increased harvest index raises yield and reduces straw and also produces a larger yield for a given amount of nitrogen supplied. High-yielding crops will require proportionate increases in nitrogen supply from the soil and fertilizer.",

        "Comment": "Soil cation exchange capacity (CEC) depends on the extent and negative charge density of surfaces of soil mineral and organic components. Soil water sorption also depends on the extent of such surfaces, giving thus way to significant relationships between CEC and hygroscopic moisture (HM) in many soils. In this work, we explored whether CEC could be accurately predicted from HM in agricultural soils of Mediterranean and humid temperate areas in Western Europe. For this purpose, we examined 243 soils across a wide variation range of their intrinsic properties. Soil CEC was determined using 1 M ammonium acetate at pH 7 and HM at an equilibrium air relative humidity (RH) of 43% (HM43). Most of the variation of soil CEC was explained by HM43 through a linear function (CEC = 1.4 + 0.78HM43; R2 = 0.962; standard deviation = 2.30 cmolc/kg). Coefficients of the regression equation were similar for subgroups of soils differing in moisture regime, clay mineralogy, carbonate content and organic carbon content. Therefore, soil hygroscopic moisture measurements at a fixed RH level provided a simple, robust, inexpensive method for predicting soil CEC.",

The article discusses measurements and models used to predict water flow and nitrate supply, before drawing both together to consider prediction of nitrate loss. The difficulties and advantages of some of the current approaches to predicting nitrate losses from agricultural systems are highlighted. Models can never be completely independent of measurements. Data are required not only for compilation and evaluation of models but each simulation also requires input data and parameters. The integrated use of both measurements and modelling approaches in the prediction of nitrate losses is therefore advised, with the actual combination of measurements and models controlled by the question to be answered, its scale and the data available. All predictions should be presented in a way that tempers them with an estimate of their reliability, in terms that are readily understood. Where such data are not presented, poor decisions may be made and unacceptable environmental impact or risk may result.",

These showed that the magnitude and duration of the effect of lime applications varied with soil type, initial pH, fertilizer nitrogen application, and the crop grown. Simple equations for each situation were linked to form an empirical model which, with appropriate input data for soil type, crop, and initial and target pH, predicted the lime needed to reach that pH. Model predictions compared well with estimates from a Woodruff-type buffer method. The model forms a sound basis for a more comprehensive lime requirement model covering the whole of the United Kingdom. -Authors",

        "Comment": "Data sets were accumulated of annual average maximum, minimum and mean air temperature from a range of sites worldwide, specifically from non-urban locations such as agricultural research institutes, universities and other rural or island locations for the period 1975\u20132011 or longer where data were available. The data sets were then analysed using linear regression to determine the rate and direction of change in temperature over the reference periods. This analysis was performed to provide vegetable scientists with likely future temperature change scenarios up to 2025 and 2050 (on the assumption that recent trends are maintained) so that breeding, agronomic and other related research programmes may better respond to potential challenges from abiotic and biotic stresses to vegetable production. Substantial variation was evident between sites and between time runs at specific sites. At some locations rapid increases in air temperature are projected, such as for sites in East Asia, but at other locations little change is evident; in rare cases, local cooling is shown. The implications of variability and change in air temperature in the context of constraints to vegetable production and the opportunities to exploit the range of genetic diversity available in climatically uncertain environments are discussed. It is believed that modern agricultural science can address successfully the problems raised by climate uncertainty, yet the lack of sufficient, immediate investment in horticultural disciplines worldwide places the world at severe risk of failing to attain effective food and nutritional security.",

        "Comment": "Pyrogenic organic carbon (PyOC) derived from incomplete burning of biomass is considered the most persistent fraction of soil organic carbon (SOC), being expected to remain in soil for centuries. However, PyOC persistence has seldom been evaluated under field conditions. Based on a unique set of soils from five European long-term bare fallows (LTBF), i.e., vegetation-free field experiments, we provide the first direct comparison between PyOC and SOC persistence in temperate arable soils. We found that soil PyOC contents decreased more rapidly than expected from current concepts, the mean residence time (MRT) of native PyOC being just 1.6 times longer than that of SOC. At the oldest experimental site, 55% of the initial PyOC remained after 80 years of bare fallow. Our results suggest that while the potential for long-term C storage exists, the persistence of PyOC in soil may currently be overestimated. ",

Compound-specific stable 13C isotope analysis of phospholipid fatty acids (13C-phospholipid fatty acid analysis) was used to explore which microbial group utilized biochar distinguished with pHs and C availability. C4 Miscanthus biochar (?13C\u00a0=\u00a0?12.2\u2030) was prepared at 2 pyrolysis temperatures (350\u00a0\u00b0C and 700\u00a0\u00b0C) and applied (50\u00a0mg C g?1 soil) to a very acid soil (pH\u00a03.7, ?13C\u00a0=\u00a0?27.7\u2030), which was sampled from the long term Hoosfield Acid Strip experiment at Rothamsted Research, and incubated for 14\u00a0months. Biochar700 increased soil pH to 5.1 and biochar350 increased soil pH to 4.3. All microbial groups (Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, actinobacteria, and fungi) were more abundant in the biochar-treated soils. The 13C values of biomarker phospholipid fatty acid analysis suggested that all groups of microorganisms, and especially Gram-positive bacteria, were using the C from the biochar350, but not the biochar700, as a substrate. We conclude that its utilization of biochar by microorganisms after 14\u00a0months was largely determined by the pyrolysis temperature controlling the availability of biochar C, instead of the pH effects, in a very acidic soil.",

        "Comment": "The objective was to develop and adapt a versatile analytical method for the quantification of solvent extractable, saturated Ion.-chain fatty acids in aquatic and terrestrial environments. Fulvic (FA) and humic (HA) acids, dissolved organic matter (DOM) in water, as well as organic matter in whole soils (SOM) of different horizons were investigated. The proposed methodology comprised extraction by dichloromethane/acetone and derivatization with tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) followed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and library searches. The C-10:0 to C-34:0 methyl esters of n-alkyl fatty acids were used as external standards for calibration. The total concentrations Of C-14:0 to C-28:0 n-alkyl fatty acids were determined in DOM obtained by reverse-osmosis of Suwannee river water (309.3 mug g(-1)), in freeze-dried brown lake water (180.6 mug g(-1)), its DOM concentrate (93.0 mug g(-1)), humic acid (43.1 mug g(-1)) and fulvic acid (42.5 mug g(-1)). The concentrations of the methylated fatty acids (n-C16:0 to 12-C28:0) were significantly (r(2) = 0.9999) correlated with the proportions of marker signals (% total ion intensity (TII), m/z 256 to m/z 508) in the corresponding pyrolysis-field ionization (FI) mass spectra. The concentrations of terrestrial C-10:0 to C-34:0 n-alkyl fatty acids from four soil samples ranged from 0.02 mug g(-1) to 11 mug g(-1). The total concentrations of the extractable fatty acids were quantified from a Podzol Bh horizon (26.2 mug g(-1)), Phaeozem Ap unfertilized (48.1 mug g(-1)), Phaeozem Ap fertilized (57.7 mug g(-1)) and Gleysol Ap (66.7 mug g(-1)). Our results demonstrate that the method is well suited to investigate the role of long-chain fatty acids in humic fractions, whole soils and their particle-size fractions and can be serve for the differentiation of plant growth and soil management.",

        "Comment": "The stability of soil organic matter (SOM) is a major source of uncertainty in predicting atmospheric CO2 concentration during the 21st century. Isolating the stable soil carbon (C) from other, more labile, C fractions in soil is of prime importance for calibrating soil C simulation models, and gaining insights into the mechanisms that lead to soil C stability. Long-term experiments with continuous bare fallow (vegetation-free) treatments in which the decay of soil C is monitored for decades after all inputs of C have stopped, provide a unique opportunity to assess the quantity of stable soil C.We analyzed data from six bare fallow experiments of long-duration (>30 yrs), covering a range of soil types and climate conditions, and sited at Askov (Denmark), Grignon and Versailles (France), Kursk (Russia), Rothamsted (UK), and Ultuna (Sweden). A conceptual three pool model dividing soil C into a labile pool (turnover time of a several years), an intermediate pool (turnover time of a several decades) and a stable pool (turnover time of a several centuries or more) fits well with the long term C decline observed in the bare fallow soils. The estimate of stable C ranged from 2.7 g C kg-1 at Rothamsted to 6.8 g C kg-1 at Grignon. The uncertainty associated with estimates of the stable pool was large due to the short duration of the fallow treatments relative to the turnover time of stable soil C. At Versailles, where there is least uncertainty associated with the determination of a stable pool, the soil contains predominantly stable C after 80 years of continuous bare fallow. Such a site represents a unique research platform for characterization of the nature of stable SOM and its vulnerability to global change.",

        "Comment": "In several plots of the Broadbalk (Hertfordshire) continuous wheat Triticum aestivum experiments total soil N content has remained constant for at least 100 yr so that annual inputs of N are balanced by annual outputs. Between 1980-1983 15N-labelled fertiliser was applied to microplots within certain plots. For the plot receiving (nominally) 144 kg N ha-1 as fertiliser annually, 79% of the fertiliser N was retained in the crop:soil system and the average annual removal of N in grain and straw was 140 kg ha-1. Total annual loss of N was calculated as 54 kg ha-1 and, in order to maintain steady state conditions, it was necessary to postulate an annual input of 48 kg N ha-1 from non-fertiliser sources. This input was similar for fertiliser N rates between 0-192 kg ha-1. Values for loss and non-fertiliser input are conservative. Part of the non-fertiliser input will be in rain (currently 10<>0n\\15 kg N ha-1 yr-1) and seed (4 kg N ha-1 yr-1). There will be contributions from dry deposition of NH3, NOx and HNO3 onto soil and foliage. Although biological fixation of atmospheric N2 by heterotrophic bacteria does not appear to be important, fixation by photosynthetic cyanobacteria may contribute significantly. -from Authors",

        "Comment": "Morphological and physiological differences have evolved between populations of Anthoxanthum odoratum growing in the Park Grass Experiment, Rothamsted, UK, within a period of less than 60 years and over distances of less than a metre [See PBA 44, 1739]. Reciprocal transplants were made of pairs of contrasting populations collected from the Park Grass Experiment. In most cases, plants survived longer, produced more tillers and more dry matter in their native plots than when transplanted into contrasting plots. The average half life of plants transplanted into contrasting plots was eight months whilst that of plants in their native plots was about two years. The coefficients of selection against the alien populations, based on survival after 18 months, ranged from 0.09 to 0.77 with a mean value of 0.36. Coefficients of selections were also calculated for tiller number and plant weight. The coefficients of selection on the various plots were correlated with the yield of herbage on the plots and with the vegetation height on the plots. It is concluded that selection pressures acting upon A. odoratum in the contrasting environments that occur in the Park Grass Experiment are large and sufficient to account for the morphological and physiological differences observed between populations on the plots.",

The differences in populations have evolved over distances of about 30 m and within 50 years. Morphological differences between populations continued up to 3 years after collection. Some, e.g. plant height and plant yield, increased with time and some were shown to be seed transmitted. More than 90% of the variation between populations, for several characters, could be accounted for by differences in single analogous environmental variables on their source plots.

        "Comment": "Populations of A. odoratum were collected at intervals across two boundaries between contrasting plots of the Park Grass Experiment, Rothamsted, UK. One boundary (8L/9L) had been in existence for 112 years, and the other (IL/IU) for 60 years. Environmental conditions at both boundaries changed to almost the maximum extent within 0.5 m.There were significant differences in height, yield, flowering date, and other morphological attributes between populations collected only 0.1 m apart at each boundary, when grown in spaced-plant trials. The sharpest differences occurred between populations collected close to the boundary.The patterns of variation of morphological attributes across one boundary (8L/9L) closely followed the patterns of environmental conditions and vegetation which were relatively simple. The patterns of variation of morphological attributes across the other boundary (IL/IU) were not simply related to the patterns of environmental conditions or vegetation which were complex. Reverse clines occurred especially at the IL/IU boundary. At both boundaries, the population collected at the boundary flowered 4-6 days earlier than adjacent populations and there appeared to be partial reproductive isolation between these populations and adjacent populations. Most attributes were highly heritable. Population samples collected in situ as seed were closely similar to population samples collected as tillers. The similarities were greatest for populations collected furthest from the boundary. Comparisons of populations grown from seed and tiller collections indicated that gene flow was greatest 0.2 m downwind of the boundary, but rapidly declined to a small level at 2 m.

The recent concepts of P and K behaviour in soil, and the risk that other inputs, especially nitrogen (N) fertilizers, will be used inefficiently if there is too little P and K in the crop-soil system, are reviewed. The need to maintain an appropriate soil pH is discussed.",

        "Comment": "Models developed in continuous-time have been used to study the epidemiology and population dynamics of plant hosts, usually in cultivated systems. Here discrete-time SIR\u2013type models are developed which contain parameters representing characteristics of an uncultivated, biennial host plant \u2013 systemic, castrating pathogen system. This thesis presents 4 epidemiological model forms representing a generic SIR model, a constant pathogen-induced mortality model, a variable pathogen-induced mortality model, and a model which has an additional phase representing a seedbank. Using a range of parameter values it is possible to produce simulation outcomes with population crashes, cycles and steady-state  populations. For each of the models a pathogen epidemic criterion is derived as is a term describing population steady-state values. For the pathogen-induced mortality models, the invasion criteria include a pathogenicity term indicating that the pathogen in part regulates the host population dynamics. The biennial host plant Tragopogon pratensis has been recorded in the Park Grass Experiment and has been described as an outbreak species regulated by the autoecious, demicyclic rust fungus, Puccinia hysterium (Silvertown et al., 2006). The rust is shown to castrate the host plant by reducing the numbers of seed set and the viability of seeds produced by infected individuals. Further characteristics of this host \u2013 pathogen system are identified by using the developed models. This is justified as the recurrence relationships derived from the models fit the observed data, and that the accuracy of the fit is increased with larger values of pathogen-induced mortality. These models produce simulation outcomes that are similar to the host population dynamics. The models also  show that the system is governed by density-dependent factors.",

        "Comment": "It has been debated, ever since Charles Darwin and Alfred Russell Wallace disagreed about the matter, whether natural selection plays a role in reinforcing reproductive isolation during the earliest stages of speciation. Recent theory suggests that it can do so, but until now the empirical evidence has conspicuously lacked a case in which reinforcement has actually been observed to split a population. We show that this has occurred at least once in populations of the grass Anthoxanthum odoratum growing in the Park Grass Experiment where flowering time has shifted at the boundaries between plots. As a consequence, gene flow via pollen has been severely limited and adjacent populations that had a common origin at the start of the experiment in 1856 have now diverged at neutral marker loci.",

        "Comment": "Soil organic matter (SOM) is important for maintaining soil structural stability (SSS). This study quantified the influence of soil organic carbon (SOC) and different organic matter components on various SSS measures. We used a silt loam soil with a wide range of SOC (8.0\u201342.7?g?kg?1 minerals) sampled in spring 2015 from the Highfield Ley-Arable Long-Term Experiment at Rothamsted Research. Four treatments were sampled: Bare fallow, continuous arable rotation, ley-arable rotation, and grass. Soils were tested for clay dispersibility (DispClay), clay-SOM disintegration (DI, the ratio between clay content without and with SOM removal) and dispersion of particles <20??m. The SSS tests were related to SOC, permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC), hot water-extractable carbon (HWC), mid-infrared photoacoustic spectroscopy (FTIR-PAS) and mineral fines/SOC ratio. SSS increased with increasing content of SOM components. The relationships between SOM components and SSS followed a broken-stick regression with a change point at ~23.0?g?SOC?kg?1 minerals (clay/SOC~10) coinciding with a change from the tilled treatments to the grass treatment. We found a greater influence of SOC, POXC and HWC on SSS at contents below the change point than above. A stronger linear relation between POXC and DispClay compared to SOC and HWC suggests that POXC was a better predictor of the variation in DispClay. POXC and HWC were less related to DI than SOC. The grass treatment had a very stable structure, shown in all SSS tests, probably due to the absence of tillage and large annual inputs of stabilizing agents. This suggests that a change in management from arable rotation to permanent grass is one effective tool for improving SSS.",

        "Comment": "A key finding in soil carbon studies over the past decade is that soil organic carbon (SOC) stabilization is not controlled by its molecular complexity or adsorption to clay, but by its physicochemical protection including occlusion in aggregates and sorption-precipitation with organo-mineral associations. The organo-mineral complexes and the adsorbed SOC can be dissolved microbially under anoxic conditions, which is an important pathway in carbon cycle but has been overlooked by most carbon models. As organo-mineral associations are reported to form in aerobic conditions and can be lost under anaerobic conditions, there should be a positive correlation between SOC and ability of the aggregates to transport dissolved oxygen. We develop a simulation model to test this using soil structural data from two long-term experiments which naturally created a SOC gradient: One is a winter wheat experiment established in 1843 to compare the effects of different fertilizations on the yield of winter wheat and the other one is a ley-arable experiment established in 1948 to investigate the consequence of cropping system changes for ecological yield. Aggregates from different treatments on the two experiments were scanned using X-ray Computed Tomography to simulate oxygen transport using a pore-scale model. We compared porosity and diffusion coefficient of all aggregates and linked them to SOC measured from the two experiments. The agronomic practice changes which occurred 67 or 172 years ago substantially reshaped the intra-aggregate structure (<2 mm), and the accrual of SOC is positively correlated with diffusion coefficient of the aggregates to transport oxygen. However, the diffusion coefficient increases with SOC asymptotically, plateauing when SOC exceeds a threshold value. We also found the diffusion coefficient of the aggregates in chemically fertilized soils trended with their porosity approximately in the same way, deviating from those for other non-cropped treatments or fertilized with farmyard manure.",

        "Comment": "Continued fertilizer applications in excess of those required for optimum plant growth can increase soil phosphorus (P) concentration and the potential for P movement to surface waters, which can contribute to freshwater eutrophication, Although soil test methods were developed for soil fertility assessment and fertilizer recommendations, they are frequently used for environmental risk assessment because of a lack of consensus on what constitutes a technically defensible environmental soil P test. Several studies have found soil test P (STP) is related to the concentration or release of P into soil solution-overland, subsurface, or drainage flow-by two linear relationships of significantly different slopes (P < 0.05) on either side of a change point for a limited number of soils. Thus, we investigated the existence and behavior of a change point in soil P release for a wide range of variously managed soils from the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and the United States, The soils varied in pH (3.0-8.2), organic C (1-172 g kg(-1)), and P (2-173 mg kg(-1) as 0.5M NaHCO3 extractable P (Olsen P) and 21-553 mg kg(-1) as Mehlich-3 P), Soil P release was determined by CaCl2 extraction (5:1 solution to soil ratio for 30 min). For all soils, CaCl2-P increased with STP as either Olsen or Mehlich-3 P (representing a quantity/intensity relationship typical of sorption-desorption isotherms). Statistically significant (P < 0.05) change points for Olsen P occurred in most soils (20-112 mg P kg(-1)) and for Mehlich-3 P for the United States soils (120-190 mg P kg(-1)). Soil P release (CaCl2-P) increased at a greater rate per unit STP increase above these change points than below, Where no change point was detected, it was found that sampled soils were either of low or high P saturation and, thus, were grouped below or above the change point. The change point could be estimated to within 40% of the determined value with a minimum of eight randomly selected samples (4 on either side of the change point).",

Linear regression analysis showed that, under the experimental conditions used, (small soil volume, weekly additions of all nutrients other than P) initial soil NaHCO3-soluble P accounted for more than 95% of the variance of plant-P uptake and weighted-mean L-values. The relationships between NaHCO3-soluble P, plant-P uptakes and weighted-mean L-values (labile P) were all independent of soil type and form of P fertiliser applied. In most soils, L-values increased with increasing cut number, and the rate of increase was linearly related to initial soil NaHCO3-soluble P, suggesting that NaHCO3-P measurements may provide information on the availability of initially non-isotopically exchangeable soil-P reserves. The plants removed about 68% more P from the soils than was measured as initially NaHCO3-soluble and about one-half of the labile soil-P. Labile soil-P was 3.5 times greater than initial NaHCO3-soluble P. The initial soil NaHCO3-soluble P required to provide at least 95% of maximum yield increased with increasing cut number (from 37 mg P kg-1 soil at cut 1 to 160 mg P kg-1 soil at cut 4), probably because the NaHCO3-P pool was replenished more slowly than P was removoed by the plants.",

        "Comment": "Effects of changing pH along a natural continuous gradient of a UK silty-loam soil were investigated. The site was a 200 m soil transect of the Hoosfield acid strip (Rothamsted Research, UK) which has grown continuous barley for more than 100 years. This experiment provides a remarkably uniform soil pH gradient, ranging from about pH 8.3 to 3.7. Soil total and organic C and the ratio: (soil organic C)/(soil total N) decreased due to decreasing plant C inputs as the soil pH declined. As expected, the CaCO3 concentration was greatest at very high pH values (pH > 7.5). In contrast, extractable Al concentrations increased linearly (R-2 = 0.94, p < 0.001) from below about pH 5.4, while extractable Mn concentrations were largest at pH 4.4 and decreased at lower pHs. Biomass C and biomass ninhydrin-N were greatest above pH 7. There were statistically significant relationships between soil pH and biomass C (R-2 = 0.80, p < 0.001), biomass ninhydrin-N (R-2 = 0.90, p < 0.001), organic C (R-2 = 0.83, p < 0.001) and total N (R-2 = 0.83, p < 0.001), confirming the importance of soil organic matter and pH in stimulating microbial biomass growth. Soil CO2 evolution increased as pH increased (R-2 = 0.97, p < 0.001). In contrast, the respiratory quotient (qCO(2)) had the greatest values at either end of the pH range. This is almost certainly a response to stress caused by the low p. At the highest pH, both abiotic (from CaCO3) and biotic CO2 Will be involved so the effects of high pH on biomass activity are confounded. Microbial biomass and microbial activity tended to stabilise at pH values between about 5 and 7 because the differences in organic C, total N and Al concentrations within this pH range were small. This work has established clear relationships between microbial biomass and microbial activity over an extremely wide soil pH range and within a single soil type. In contrast, most other studies have used soils of both different pH and soil type to make similar comparisons. In the latter case, the effects of soil pH on microbial properties are confounded with effects of different soil types, vegetation cover and local climatic conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This used two soils that received metal-rich sludge cake (SC). liquid sludge (LS) or metal salts (MS) additions more than 10 years previously. Soil type had the predominant influence on bacterial community structure and PICT The source of the metal contamination also had a large influence on community structure and PICT, greater than the effects due to metal concentrations. Nevertheless, in both Zn and Cu contaminated soils, PICT was observed and decreased in the order MS > LS > SC. Within a metal source and site, there was evidence of increased PICT with increasing Zn or Cu contamination, however few differences were significant as a result of high variability between sample replicates. These results highlight the importance of considering soil physico-chemical properties and the source of metal contamination as well as total metal concentrations when considering the long-term effects of metals on soil microbial communities. Further, the matrix that a metal is associated with prior to addition may play an important factor in determining levels of toxicity. This could have consequences for the interpretation and use of data from metal spiking experiments when considering metal limits for sludge application to land. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

        "Comment": "Our aim was to determine whether the soil microbial biomass, which has developed naturally over many years in a given ecosystem, is specially adapted to metabolize the plant-derived substrate C of the ecosystem within which it developed or whether the nature of recently added substrate is the more important factor. To examine this, soils from three sites in close proximity (woodland, grassland and arable from the Broadbalk Experiment at Rothamsted Research, Harpenden, UK) were each amended with air-dried wheat straw (Triticum aestivum), ryegrass leaves (Lolium perenne) or woodland leaf litter (mainly Quercus robur and Fagus sylvatica) in a fully replicated 3 x 3 factorial laboratory experiment. The initial mineralization rates (evolved CO2-C) were determined during the first 6.5 hours and again, together with the amount of microbial biomass synthesized (microbial biomass C), at 7, 14, 21, 30 and 49 days of incubation. The hourly rate of CO2-C production during the first 6.5 hours was slowest following leaf litter addition, while the added grass gave the fastest rates of CO2-C evolution both within and between soils. Ryegrass addition to the arable soil led to approximately four times more CO2-C being evolved than when it was added to the woodland soil, at an overall rate in the arable soils of 41 mu g C g(-1) soil hour(-1). In each soil, the net amounts of CO2-C produced were in the order grass > straw > leaf litter. In each case, the amount produced by the added leaf litter was significantly less (P < 0.05) than either the added grass or straw. Overall, the trend was for much slower rates of mineralization of all substrates in the woodland soil than in either the arable or grassland soils. During 49 days of incubation in the woodland and grassland soils, the net total amounts of CO2-C evolved differed significantly (P < 0.01), with grass > straw > leaf litter, respectively. In the arable soil, the amounts of CO2-C evolved from added grass and straw were significantly larger (P < 0.01) than from the leaf litter treatment. Our findings indicated that the amounts of CO2-C evolved were not related to soil management or to the size of the original biomass but to the substrate type. The amount of biomass C synthesized was also in the order grass > straw > leaf litter, at all stages of incubation in the woodland and grassland soil. In the arable soil, the same effect was observed up to 14 days, and for the rest of the incubation the biomass C synthesized was in the order grass > straw > leaf litter. Up to three times more biomass C was synthesized from the added grass than from the other substrates in all soils throughout the incubation. The maximum biomass synthesis efficiency was obtained with grass (7% of added C). Overall, the woodland soil was most efficient at synthesizing biomass C and the arable soil the least. We conclude that substrate type was the overriding factor that determined the amount of new soil microbial biomass synthesized. Mineralization of substrate C by soil microorganisms was also influenced mainly by substrate type and less by soil management or size of original biomass.",

        "Comment": "Soil samples were collected from plots on Broadbalk, Hoosfield and Barnfield and from Broadbalk Wilderness, and their Fusarium content was estimated by plating on the Nash medium, selective for Fusarium. At the same time isolations of Fusarium were made from diseased wheat and barley plants where present in the plots. Of the Fusarium pathogens recovered, F. roseum f. cerealis \u2018Culmorum\u2019 was found in high populations, i.e. 2000\u20133000 or more propagules per g of soil in Broadbalk continuously sown to wheat, and the same fungus was recovered from brown lesions on culms of wheat growing in these plots. The most \u2018Culmorum\u2019 occurred where complete fertilization, including much nitrogen, had been applied, and fewest where fertilizer had not been used. On Barnfield, where only broad-leaved crops have been grown for more than 100 years, and in Broadbalk Wilderness, \u2018Culmorum\u2019 was very rare. Although F. nivale and its perithecial state, Calonectria nivalis, were commonly isolated from fusarium-infected wheat and barley plants at Rothamsted in addition to F. roseum \u2018Culmorum\u2019, the snow mould Fusarium was not recovered from the soil. This agrees with the fact that F. nivale does not normally form chlamydospores, whereas \u2018Culmorum\u2019 produces them abundantly and therefore is ideally soil-borne.",

There is concern over the present state of rough grasslands and changes that may be occurring in their composition over time. The longest-running experiment on the effect of different fertiliser regimes on grassland cut for hay, the Park Grass Experiment at Rothamsted, provides a wealth of botanical diversity for an initial investigation. The display shows and discusses the radiant qualities of the cover types and describes the procedures adopted in analysing the data. A great deal of variation between treatments (fertiliser regimes) was easily identified. The sub-plots within a treatment (different pH levels) were also distinct for most regimes. -Authors",

        "Comment": "Abstract Rothamsted's Woburn Ley-arable experiment, started in 1938 on a sandy loam soil, provides valuable real-world data on the effects of all-arable and ley-arable rotations. In this study, six rotations were compared from 1973-2001. Two had 3-year arable \u201ctreatment\u201d crops, two had 3-year leys and two had 8-year leys; the leys being all grass given fertiliser nitrogen (Ln3 and Ln8), or grass/clover (Lc3 and Lc8). Here we present the yields of two test crops, winter wheat (1981-2000) followed by spring barley (1982-1991) or winter rye (1997-2001) in each of the six rotations; and their response to four rates of fertiliser N and soil N. From fitted yield/N response curves, we show that maximum wheat yields were least (7.10 t ha- 1) in the AB rotation, slightly higher, but not significantly so (7.65 t ha-1) following Ln leys but significantly higher (8.12 t ha-1) following Lc leys. Significantly less fertiliser N (30 kg ha-1) was needed to achieve the higher yields following Lc leys. Yields of the second cereal following the leys were 0.3-0.8 t ha-1 higher than those in the AB rotation; these increases were not statistically significant. However, significantly less fertiliser N, 26-38 kg N ha-1, was required to achieve those yields. There was no difference found between the type of ley. The initial benefit of the Lc leys was short-lived. If leys are to be introduced into mainly arable farming systems, they may need to be subsidised to make them financially viable.",

        "Comment": "Leafhoppers were sampled from 13 plots receiving different fertiliser treatments in the classical Park Grass Experiment, Rothamsted. Samples were taken, on five summer dates in both 1977 and 1978, from near-neutral and more acid subplots, maintained by differential liming. Of 47 species recorded, <i>Psammotettix confinis</i> was the most abundant. The fauna was characterised by species of acidic, not calcareous, grassland. Few univoltine species were recorded. Species richness was greater on the near-neutral subplots, on which four species were significantly more numerous. <i>Psammotettix confinis</i> was more abundant on the more acid subplots. More species were taken from the plots receiving no nitrogen fertiliser than from fertilised plots, and the abundance of eight species was significantly correlated with the amounts applied. Positive and negative correlations were recorded, with most effects on either the near-neutral or more acid subplots, but not both. The numbers of the two species were negatively correlated with application of minerals. Abundance of total Auchenorhyncha and of <i>Psammotettix confinis</i> was negatively correlated with yield of hay. The faunas of the neutral subplots were less similar in both 1977 and 1978 than those of the more acidic subplots. Yearly differences in abundance of some species are tentatively ascribed to the greater summer rainfall in 1978 compared with 1977. The mediation of treatment through vegetational changes is considered. The distribution and abundance of some species correlated with increased abundance of their food plants through acidification of the grassland by ammonium sulphate. The ecology of species associated with <i>Holcus lanatus</i> is discussed. A principal components analysis was made using the covariance matrix of 1 n (n + 1) abundances. The first two axes broadly expressed amounts of nitrogen applied and pH, and accounted for 29% and 21 % of the total variation, respectively. The results are compared with other zoological work on Park Grass. The responses of Auchnorhyncha are clear, despite their potential for movement between subplots.",

        "Comment": "Changes in the clay mineralogy of soil samples collected from the Rothamsted Classical Experiments over the past similar to 150 years were examined. Comparisons were undertaken to assess the impact of (i) different fertiliser practices on the top soil and sub soil of the Park Grass Experiment and (ii) the effects of changing land use from agriculture to woodland where soil pH either remained close to pH 7 or became acidic. Analyses were undertaken on the <0.2 mu m clay fraction and measurements included cation exchange capacity (CEC), surface area and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The fine clay fraction of all the samples is composed of illite/smectite (I/S), illite and kaolinite minerals. Decomposition modelling of XRD spectra identified three I/S phases including (i) a high smectite I/S phase (d(001) similar to 15 angstrom), 00 a low smectite I/S phase (d(001) similar to 12.5 angstrom) and (iii) an illite phase (d(001) similar to 11.2 angstrom). The I/S phase is typically made up of similar to 60% of high smectite I/S, similar to 20% low smectite I/S and similar to 20% illite. Attempts to account for changes in clay CEC and surface area with time proved to be inconclusive, possibly because of the differing proportions of the three I/S phases in each sample. Some temporal changes in the d(001) spacing of I/S mineral phases from the decomposed XRD spectra (>0.4 angstrom) are reported in both top soil (0-23 cm) and sub soil (46-69 cm) and are likely related to (i) changes in soil K+ or NH4+ status and/or (ii) increasing soil acidity. The greatest change was found in the Park Grass Experiment (NH4)(2)SO4 plot where soil pH fell below 3.7. It is believed that solubilisation of hydroxyl-Al in smectite interlayers enabled renewed access to K+ or NH4+ ions, leading to increased collapse in d(001) spacing. However, the results show that over a diverse range of soil conditions, I/S minerals of the Batcombe series soils showed considerable resilience to major change. This is considered to be a result of competition for sorption sites by (i) the presence of competing ions added as fertiliser or liming materials, (ii) an increase in H+ ions as soil acidity increases, (iii) the possible role of organic carbon in protecting I/S minerals and (iv) the role of the I/S minerals as K+ reservoirs. However. the impact of decreasing soil pH should be considered when land is reforested as this may lead to decreases in the d(001) spacing of I/S minerals, thus compromising useful clay properties such as CEC.

        "Comment": "Summary Weedy plants pose a major threat to food security, biodiversity, ecosystem services and consequently to human health and wellbeing. However, many currently used weed management approaches are increasingly unsustainable. To address this knowledge and practice gap, in June 2014, 35 weed and invasion ecologists, weed scientists, evolutionary biologists and social scientists convened a workshop to explore current and future perspectives and approaches in weed ecology and management. A horizon scanning exercise ranked a list of 124 pre-submitted questions to identify a priority list of 30 questions. These questions are discussed under seven themed headings that represent areas for renewed and emerging focus for the disciplines of weed research and practice. The themed areas considered the need for transdisciplinarity, increased adoption of integrated weed management and agroecological approaches, better understanding of weed evolution, climate change, weed invasiveness and finally, disciplinary challenges for weed science. Almost all the challenges identified rested on the need for continued efforts to diversify and integrate agroecological, socio-economic and technological approaches in weed management. These challenges are not newly conceived, though their continued prominence as research priorities highlights an ongoing intransigence that must be addressed through a more system-oriented and transdisciplinary research agenda that seeks an embedded integration of public and private research approaches. This horizon scanning exercise thus set out the building blocks needed for future weed management research and practice; however, the challenge ahead is to identify effective ways in which sufficient research and implementation efforts can be directed towards these needs.",

        "Comment": "Soil organic matter (SOM) is essential for sustaining food production and maintaining ecosystem services and is a vital resource base for storing C and N. The impact of long-term use of synthetic fertilizer N on SOM, however, has been questioned recently. Here we tested the hypothesis that long-term application of N results in a decrease in SOM. We used data from 135 studies of 114 long-term experiments located at 100 sites throughout the world over time scales of decades under a range of land-management and climate regimes to quantify changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil organic nitrogen (SON). Published data of a total of 917 and 580 observations for SOC and SON, respectively, from control (unfertilized or zero N) and N-fertilized treatments (synthetic, organic, and combination) were analyzed using the SAS mixed model and by meta-analysis. Results demonstrate declines of 7 to 16% in SOC and 7 to 11% in SON with no N amendments. In soils receiving synthetic fertilizer N, the rate of SOM loss decreased. Th e time-fertilizer response ratio, which is based on changes in the paired comparisons, showed average increases of 8 and 12% for SOC and SON, respectively, following the application of synthetic fertilizer N. Addition of organic matter (i.e., manure) increased SOM, on average, by 37%. When cropping systems fluctuated between flooding and drying, SOM decreased more than in continuous dryland or flooded systems. Flooded rice (Oryza sativa L.) soils show net accumulations of SOC and SON. Th is work shows a general decline in SOM for all long-term sites, with and without synthetic fertilizer N. However, our analysis also demonstrates that in addition to its role in improving crop productivity, synthetic fertilizer N significantly reduces the rate at which SOM is declining in agricultural soils, worldwide.",

        "Comment": "In 1993, Rothamsted Experimental Station, the oldest agricultural research institute in the world, celebrated 150 years of experimental work on the production of farm crops. Most of the station's 'classical experiments', begun by its founder John (later Sir John) Lawes between 1843 and 1856, continue today and provide useful information for contemporary agriculture and ecology which Lawes could never have envisaged. These include development of a model for the turnover of organic matter in soil, assessments of the increasing pollution of soil by toxic metals and organic carcinogens resulting from twentieth century industrial activities, and insights into the ecological consequences of changes in agricultural policies. The experiments also provide many examples of the value of long term, systematic data collection and interdisciplinary research in agricultural production, ecology and environmental pollution. Facilities for this work became available through the scientific flair and foresight of Lawes, and since his death have been maintained and extended by generations of dedicated scientists.",

        "Comment": "The extent to which divergent selection can drive genome-wide population differentiation remains unclear. Theory predicts that in the face of ongoing gene flow, population differentiation should be apparent only at those markers that are directly or indirectly (i.e. through linkage) under selection. However, if reproductive barriers limit gene flow, genome-wide population differentiation may occur even in geographically proximate populations. Some insight into the link between selection and genetic differentiation in the presence of ongoing gene flow can come from long-term experiments such as The Park Grass Experiment, which has been running for over 150 years, and provides a unique example of a heterogeneous environment with a long and detailed history. Fertilizer treatments applied in the Park Grass Experiment have led to rapid evolutionary change in sweet vernal grass Anthoxanthum odoratum, but until now, nothing was known of how these changes would be reflected in neutral molecular markers. We have genotyped ten A. odoratum populations from the Park Grass Experiment using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs). Our data show that nutrient additions have resulted in genome-wide divergence among plots despite the high potential for ongoing gene flow. This provides a well-documented example of concordance between genomes and environmental conditions that has arisen in continuous populations across a time span of fewer than 75 generations.",

        "Comment": "Deficiencies of micronutrients, including essential trace elements, affect up to 3 billion people worldwide. The dietary availability of trace elements is determined largely by their soil concentrations. Until now, the mechanisms governing soil concentrations have been evaluated in small-scale studies, which identify soil physicochemical properties as governing variables. However, global concentrations of trace elements and the factors controlling their distributions are virtually unknown. We used 33,241 soil data points to model recent (1980\u20131999) global distributions of Selenium (Se), an essential trace element that is required for humans. Worldwide, up to one in seven people have been estimated to have low dietary Se intake. Contrary to small-scale studies, soil Se concentrations were dominated by climate\u2013soil interactions. Using moderate climate-change scenarios for 2080\u20132099, we predicted that changes in climate and soil organic carbon content will lead to overall decreased soil Se concentrations, particularly in agricultural areas; these decreases could increase the prevalence of Se deficiency. The importance of climate\u2013soil interactions to Se distributions suggests that other trace elements with similar retention mechanisms will be similarly affected by climate change. ",

        "Comment": "Changes in land use affect the pore size distribution (PSD) of the soil, and hence important soil functions such as gas exchange, water availability and plant growth. The objective of this study was to investigate potentially damaging and restorative soil management practices on soil pore structure. We quantified the rate of change in PSD six years after changes in land use taking advantage of the Highfield land-use change experiment at Rothamsted Research. This experiment includes short-term soil degradation and restoration scenarios established simultaneously within long-term contrasting treatments that had reached steady-state equilibrium. The land-use change scenarios comprised conversion to grassland of previously arable or bare fallow soil, and conversion of grassland to arable and bare fallow soils. In the laboratory, we exposed intact soil cores (100?cm3) to matric potentials ranging from ?10?hPa to -1.5?MPa. Based on equivalent soil mass, the plant available water capacity decreased after conversion from grassland, whereas no change was observed after conversion to grassland. Structural void ratio decreased after termination of grassland and introduction of grassland in bare fallow soil, while no change was seen when changing arable to grassland. Consequently, it was faster to degrade than to restore a complex soil structure. The study illustrates that introducing grassland in degraded soil may result in short-term increase in soil density.",

        "Comment": "The short-term effects of N addition on CH4 oxidation were studied in two soils at Rothamsted Experimental Station, UK. Both sites are unfertilized; one has been under long-term arable rotation, and the other is a grassland that has been cut for hay for the past 125 years. The sites showed clear differences in their capacity to oxidise CH4, the arable soil oxidised CH4 at a rate of 0.013 micro g CH4 kg-1 h-1 and the grassland soil approximately an order of magnitude quicker. In both sites the addition of (NH4)2SO4 caused an immediate reduction in the rate of atmospheric CH4 oxidation approximately in inverse proportion to the amount of NH4+ added. The addition of KNO3 caused no change in the rate of CH4 oxidation in the arable soil, but in the grassland soil after 9 days the rate of CH4 oxidation had decreased from 0.22 micro g CH4 kg-1 h-1 to 0.13 micro g CH4 kg-1 h-1 in soil treated with the equivalent of 192 kg N ha-1. A 15N isotopic dilution technique was used to investigate the role of nitrifiers in regulating CH4 oxidation. The arable soil showed a low rate of gross N mineralisation (0.67 mg N kg-1 day-1), but a relatively high proportion of the mineralised N was nitrified. The grassland soil had a high rate of gross N mineralisation (18.28 mg N kg-1 day-1), but negligible nitrification activity. It is thought that since there was virtually no nitrification in the grassland soil then CH4 oxidation at this site must be methanotroph mediated.",

        "Comment": "The changing populations of weeds during 13 years of the Broadbalk continuous wheat experiment were analysed to investigate the extent of differences in short-term variability of cover between species. Data were from two sections of the experiment where winter wheat was grown continuously under herbicide treatment for 13 and six years respectively. Equisetum arvense showed significant long-term increases on both sections; long-term trends were also detected in the longer data run for Agrostis stolonifera, Cirsium arvensa, Poa trivialis, Ranunculus arvensis and Vicia sativa, and for Medicago lupulina on the shorter data run. Variation around long-term trends was low in the case of Equisetum, and, in the longer data run, for Cirsium and Tussilago farfara, and high for Poa spp. and Vicia. Cover values on the two sections were positively correlated for Alopecurus myosuroides, Equisetum, Poa annua and Tripleurospermum inodorum. There was a weak correlation between C-S-R strategy and short-term variability; the more competitive species displayed less variability than the ruderal species. Species regenerating from persistent seed banks were more variable in the short term than those regenerating from short-lived seed or bud banks. This can be explained by differences in response to year-to-year variation in environmental conditions, those species with persistent seed banks being typically more sensitive to annual fluctuations in the environment than those without. -Author",

        "Comment": "Agricultural practices can have significant effects on the physical and biological properties of soil. The aim of this study was to understand how the physical structure of a compromised soil, arising from long-term bare-fallow management, was modified by adopting different field management practices. We hypothesized that changing agricultural practices from bare-fallow to arable or grassland would influence the modification of pore structure via an increase in porosity and pore connectivity, and a more homogenous distribution of pore sizes, and that this change exerts a rapid evolution of soil structure following conversion. Soil aggregates (<2?mm) collected in successive years from field plots subjected to three contrasting managements were studied: bare-fallow, bare-fallow converted to arable, and bare-fallow converted to grassland. Soil structure was assessed by X-ray computed tomography on the aggregates at 1.5 ?m resolution, capturing detail relevant to soil biophysical processes. The grassland system increased porosity, diversity of pore sizes, pore connectivity and pore-surface density significantly over the decade following conversion. However, measured at this resolution, the evolution of most of these metrics of soil structure required approximately 10?years post-conversion to show a significant effect. The arable system did not influence soil structural evolution significantly. Only pore size distribution was modified in grassland in a shorter time frame (2?years post-conversion). Hence, evolution of soil structural characteristics appears to require at least a decadal timescale following conversion to grassland. Highlights The physical structure of a compromised soil was modified by adopting plant-based field management practices. Conversion to grassland increased pore size diversity after 2?years. Porosity, pore connectivity and pore surface density showed a significant modification between 7 and 10?years after conversion.",

        "Comment": "The widely used ecosystem model DailyDayCent (DDC) was used to predict soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and yield under different fertilization treatments on a wheat (Triticum aestivum) monoculture on Broadbalk field, Rothamsted, UK. Over a period of about 170 years, the management practices on the test site, which is separated into plots with different treatments of fertilizer and manure application, are well documented. Four treatments consisting of control (no fertilizer), mineral nitrogen (N) fertilizer (MN), farm yard manure (FYM) and a combination of both (FYMN) have been selected for the study. DDC simulated the greatest increases in SOC (three times higher compared to simulation of the control plot) in the FYM plot. Overall a good agreement between modelled and measured yield was obtained (except in control plots). As observed in the experimental plots, the highest yield predicted by the model is with FYMN plot (more than three times higher relative to the control plot). A sensitivity test for the MN and FYM plots demonstrated that predicted SOC was relatively insensitive (1%) to bulk density, pH and field capacity. Higher sensitivity (4-7%) of predicted SOC changes were observed by changes in external C input. An increase of temperature by 1 A degrees C or precipitation by 10% decreased predicted SOC by 2-4% and vice versa, and simulated a 1-4% variability in yield. DDC is a useful tool for simulating SOC in the long term plots, with a good fit to data, and is useful for examining alternate hypotheses of yield and SOC responses.",

        "Comment": "As part of a model evaluation exercise, RothC-26.3, a model for the turnover of organic carbon in non-waterlogged soils, was fitted to measurements of organic carbon from 18 different experimental treatments on 6 long-term experimental sites in Germany, England, the USA, the Czech Republic and Australia. In the fitting process, the model was first run with an annual return of plant C that had been selected iteratively to give the carbon content of the soil at the start of each experiment. This was done for the soil and climate of each site. If the radiocarbon content of the soil organic matter was known, the inert organic carbon (IOM) content of the soil was also calculated for the start of the experiment. Using these carbon and radiocarbon contents as a starting point, the model was then run for each of the experimental treatments to be fitted, using iteratively selected values for the annual return of plant materials to the soil. The value used for each treatment was selected to optimise the fit between modelled and measured data over the whole experimental period: fitting was done by eye. Thus fitted, RothC-26.3 gave an acceptable approximation to the measurements for 14 of the treatments, hearing in mind the experimental errors in measuring soil organic carbon on a per hectare ba is. With four of the treatments (Highfield Bare Fellow, Park Grass plot 13d. Ruzyne farmyard manure plot and Tamworth rotation 5), the fit was less satisfactory. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.",

        "Comment": "CANDY (CArbon and Nitrogen DYnamics) is a simulation system based on long-term experiments of organic matter turnover and nitrogen dynamics at Bad Lauchstadt, Germany. Key driving variables are soil physical properties, meteorological data and management information. The main application of the CANDY model is the calculation of short-term dynamics of nitrogen transformation and long-term dynamics of organic matter turnover in arable soils. This paper concentrates on the evaluation of the model in simulating carbon dynamics in long-term experiments representing different land uses and very different geographical sites. The experimental data came from data sets that were made available to modellers at a workshop held at Rothamsted in 1995. In this paper we describe how the different data sets were modelled and provide a qualitative assessment of model performance. The performance of several models, including CANDY, are compared quantitatively in Smith et al. (1997). ",

        "Comment": "Models are used increasingly to predict long-term changes in soil organic matter (SOM). Comparison with measured data is clearly desirable. We compared simulations of the mechanistic ITE (Edinburgh) Forest (EF) and Hurley Pasture (HP) ecosystem models with experimental SOM data from three long-term experiments: a 30 year old pine forest in South Carolina, USA, a 100 year old area of naturally regenerating woodland at Rothamsted in southeast England, and a 140 year old grass pasture subjected to various input regimes also at Rothamsted. EF's model trees died too readily during occasional periods of drought, so we cut out the water submodel (which includes leaching): the cut-down model simulated measured accumulation of C to within around 10% but greatly overestimated that of N, where leaching was in fact significant. Again, and for the same reason (plant death during drought), we had to cut the water submodel out of HP: the resulting simulations generally overestimated SOM-N, especially in treatments receiving nitrogenous inputs, and bracketed the measured SOM-C data. Simulated SOM levels responded rapidly to organic and inorganic inputs, however, whilst measured data did not. We therefore rewrote the SOM submodel to include protected and stabilised SOM pools, in an attempt to buffer the system. The new submodel showed little effect of treatment, improved SOM-N simulations, but consistently overestimated SOM-C. This mismatch between measurement and model may reflect nothing more than too shallow a sampling depth. We performed no site-specific parameter optimisation because: (1) the data sets are small; (2) it is not clear how much of the SOM in the system is contained within the experimental sampling depth; and (3) the models are mechanistic, with parameters reflecting real measurable properties of the systems they represent. In the absence of such tuning, the models should simulate other relevant systems just as well as those presented here.",

        "Comment": "The phosphorus (P) supply from soils is crucial to crop production. Given the complexity involved in P-cycling, a model that can simulate the major P-cycling processes and link with other nutrients and environmental factors, e.g., soil temperature and moisture, would be a useful tool. The aim of this study was to describe a process-based P module added to the SPACSYS (Soil Plant and Atmosphere Continuum System) model and to evaluate its predictive capability on the dynamics of P content in crops and the impact of soil P status on crop growth. A P-cycling module was developed and linked to other modules included in the SPACSYS model. We used a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum, cv Xi-19) field experiment at Rothamsted Research in Harpenden to calibrate and validate the model. Model performance statistics show that the model simulated aboveground dry matter, P accumulation and soil moisture dynamics reasonably well. Simulated dynamics of soil nitrate and ammonium were close to the observed data when P fertiliser was applied. However, there are large discrepancies in fields without P fertiliser. This study demonstrated that the SPACSYS model was able to investigate the interactions between carbon, nitrogen, P and water in a single process-based model after the tested P module was implemented",

        "Comment": "Soil acidification is caused by a number of factors including acidic precipitation and the deposition from the atmosphere of acidifying gases or particles, such as sulphur dioxide, ammonia and nitric acid. The most important causes of soil acidification on agricultural land, however, are the application of ammonium-based fertilizers and urea, elemental S fertilizer and the growth of legumes. Acidification causes the loss of base cations, an increase in aluminium saturation and a decline in crop yields; severe acidification can cause nonreversible clay mineral dissolution and a reduction in cation exchange capacity, accompanied by structural deterioration. Soil acidity is ameliorated by applying lime or other acid-neutralizing materials. \u2018Liming\u2019 also reduces N2O emissions, but this is more than offset by CO2 emissions from the lime as it neutralizes acidity. Because crop plants vary in their tolerance to acidity and plant nutrients have different optimal pH ranges, target soil pH values in the UK are set at 6.5 (5.8 in peaty soils) for cropped land and 6.0 (5.3 in peaty soils) for grassland. Agricultural lime products can be sold as \u2018EC Fertiliser Liming Materials\u2019 but, although vital for soil quality and agricultural production, liming tends to be strongly influenced by the economics of farming. Consequently, much less lime is being applied in the UK than required, and many arable and grassland soils are below optimum pH. ",

Changes in the pH of the samples show how acidification has progressed. The soils are now at, or are approaching, equilibrium pH values which depend on the acidifying inputs and on the buffering capacities of the soils. Acid rain (wet deposited acidity) is a negligible source, but total atmospheric deposition may comprise up to 30% of acidifying inputs at near neutral soil pH values and more as soil pH decreases. Excepting fertilizers, the greatest causes of soil acidification at or near neutral pH values are the natural inputs of H+ from the dissolution of CO2 and subsequent dissociation of carbonic acid, and the mineralization of organic matter. -from Authors",

Results indicated a pH change of 1.0 in the control plot and 2.2 in the fertilized plots, due to acid deposition and fertilization. Ammonium acetate, EDTA and sequential analysis were used to estimate the heavy metal contents in different fractions. There was a decrease in the Ca and Mg contents in the control plot and an increase in Zn, Cd and Pb contents. In the fertilized plots Ca, Mg and Zn contents decreased due to leaching but the Pb content increased. The McGrath sequential extraction method gave best results in long term experiments.",

        "Comment": "We use a unique set of terrestrial experiments to demonstrate how soil management practises result in emergence of distinct associations between physical structure and biological functions. These associations have a significant effect on the flux, resilience and efficiency of nutrient delivery to plants (including water). Physical structure, determining the air\u2013water balance in soil as well as transport rates, is influenced by nutrient and physical interventions. Contrasting emergent soil structures exert selective pressures upon the microbiome metagenome. These selective pressures are associated with the quality of organic carbon inputs, the prevalence of anaerobic microsites and delivery of nutrients to microorganisms attached to soil surfaces. This variety results in distinctive gene assemblages characterising each state. The nature of the interactions provide evidence that soil behaves as an extended composite phenotype of the resident microbiome, responsive to the input and turnover of plant-derived organic carbon. We provide new evidence supporting the theory that soil-microbe systems are self-organising states with organic carbon acting as a critical determining parameter. This perspective leads us to propose carbon flux, rather than soil organic carbon content as the critical factor in soil systems, and we present evidence to support this view.",

        "Comment": "Soils collected across a long-term liming experiment (pH 4.0-8.3), in which variation in factors other than pH have been minimized, were used to investigate the direct influence of pH on the abundance and composition of the two major soil microbial taxa, fungi and bacteria. We hypothesized that bacterial communities would be more strongly influenced by pH than fungal communities. To determine the relative abundance of bacteria and fungi, we used quantitative PCR (qPCR), and to analyze the composition and diversity of the bacterial and fungal communities, we used a bar-coded pyrosequencing technique. Both the relative abundance and diversity of bacteria were positively related to pH, the latter nearly doubling between pH 4 and 8. In contrast, the relative abundance of fungi was unaffected by pH and fungal diversity was only weakly related with pH. The composition of the bacterial communities was closely defined by soil pH; there was as much variability in bacterial community composition across the 180-m distance of this liming experiment as across soils collected from a wide range of biomes in North and South America, emphasizing the dominance of pH in structuring bacterial communities. The apparent direct influence of pH on bacterial community composition is probably due to the narrow pH ranges for optimal growth of bacteria. Fungal community composition was less strongly affected by pH, which is consistent with pure culture studies, demonstrating that fungi generally exhibit wider pH ranges for optimal growth.

        "Comment": "Chitin is the second most produced biopolymer on Earth after cellulose. Chitin degrading enzymes are promising but untapped sources for developing novel industrial biocatalysts. Hidden amongst uncultivated micro-organisms, new bacterial enzymes can be discovered and exploited by metagenomic approaches through extensive cloning and screening. Enrichment is also a well-known strategy, as it allows selection of organisms adapted to feed on a specific compound. In this study, we investigated how the soil bacterial community responded to chitin enrichment in a microcosm experiment. An integrative metagenomic approach coupling phylochips and high throughput shotgun pyrosequencing was established in order to assess the taxonomical and functional changes in the soil bacterial community. Results indicate that chitin enrichment leads to an increase of Actinobacteria, gamma-proteobacteria and beta-proteobacteria suggesting specific selection of chitin degrading bacteria belonging to these classes. Part of enriched bacterial genera were not yet reported to be involved in chitin degradation, like the members from the Micrococcineae sub-order (Actinobacteria). An increase of the observed bacterial diversity was noticed, with detection of specific genera only in chitin treated conditions. The relative proportion of metagenomic sequences related to chitin degradation was significantly increased, even if it represents only a tiny fraction of the sequence diversity found in a soil metagenome.",

        "Comment": "Ten years of erosion data from the Woburn Erosion Reference Experiment, Bedfordshire, United Kingdom, show that the total amount of carbon removed as particulate organic matter from individual plots ranged from 76 to 312 kg ha(-1). In general, losses were less from minimally tilled plots cultivated across the slope than from plots given standard cultivations up and down the slope. Losses of carbon by erosion accounted for 2-50% of soil carbon change. Using a sediment delivery model combined with carbon enrichment data from this study and previous literature, we calculate that the amount of carbon mobilized by erosion in England and Wales is between 0.2 and 0.76 Tg C y(-1) of which 0.12-0.46 Tg C y(-1) is delivered to surface waters. If the eroded soil carbon were completely replaced and the eroded material protected from decomposition in sediments, then there is a potential sink on eroding cropland in the UK of up to 0.75 Tg C y(-1), which represents a significant uncertainty in the terrestrial carbon budget.

        "Comment": "Abstract Over the last few years, the question of whether soil carbon sequestration could contribute significantly to climate change mitigation has been the object of numerous debates. All of these debates so far appear to have entirely overlooked a crucial aspect of the question. It concerns the short-term mineralization kinetics of fresh organic matter added to soils, which is occasionally alluded to in the literature, but is almost always subsumed in a broader modelling context. In the present article, we first summarize what is currently known about the kinetics of mineralization of plant residues added to soils, and about its modelling in the long run. We then argue that in the short run, this microbially-mediated process has important practical consequences that cannot be ignored. Specifically, since at least 90% of plant residues added to soils to increase their carbon content over the long term are mineralized relatively rapidly and are released as CO2 to the atmosphere, farmers would have to apply to their fields 10 times more organic carbon annually than what they would eventually expect to sequester. Over time, because of a well-known sink saturation effect, the multiplier may even rise significantly above 10, up to a point when no net carbon sequestration takes place any longer. The requirement to add many times more carbon than what one aims to sequester makes it practically impossible to add sufficient amounts of crop residues to soils to have a lasting, non-negligible effect on climate change. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that raising the organic matter content of soils is desirable for other reasons, in particular guaranteeing that soils will be able to keep fulfilling essential functions and services in spite of fast-changing environmental conditions.

        "Comment": "The term 'carbon sequestration' is commonly used to describe any increase in soil organic carbon (SOC) content caused by a change in land management, with the implication that increased soil carbon (C) storage mitigates climate change. However, this is only true if the management practice causes an additional net transfer of C from the atmosphere to land. Limitations of C sequestration for climate change mitigation include the following constraints: (i) the quantity of C stored in soil is finite, (ii) the process is reversible and (iii) even if SOC is increased there may be changes in the fluxes of other greenhouse gases, especially nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane. Removing land from annual cropping and converting to forest, grassland or perennial crops will remove C from atmospheric CO2 and genuinely contribute to climate change mitigation. However, indirect effects such as conversion of land elsewhere under native vegetation to agriculture could negate the benefit through increased CO2 emission. Re-vegetating degraded land, of limited value for food production, avoids this problem. Adding organic materials such as crop residues or animal manure to soil, whilst increasing SOC, generally does not constitute an additional transfer of C from the atmosphere to land, depending on the alternative fate of the residue. Increases in SOC from reduced tillage now appear to be much smaller than previously claimed, at least in temperate regions, and in some situations increased N2O emission may negate any increase in stored C. The climate change benefit of increased SOC from enhanced crop growth (for example from the use of fertilizers) must be balanced against greenhouse gas emissions associated with manufacture and use of fertilizer. An over-emphasis on the benefits of soil C sequestration may detract from other measures that are at least as effective in combating climate change, including slowing deforestation and increasing efficiency of N use in order to decrease N2O emissions.",

        "Comment": "Plant sulphur (S) deficiency is a worldwide concern. However, the mechanisms controlling the immobilization and mineralization of low-molecular weight organic S by soil microorganisms remain unclear. Therefore, we investigated the assimilation of carbon (C) and S by soil microorganisms using uniformly 14C- or 35S-labelled cysteine and methionine. The decomposition of cysteine and methionine in the soil occurred in three steps. First, the microbial biomass (MB) rapidly immobilised the added cysteine-S (55%\u201363%) and methionine-S (81%\u201384%) in less than 30\u00a0min. Subsequently, S in the MB was released as 35S-sulphate (release of S into the soil peaked at 1\u00a0h [21.4%] and 24\u00a0h [17.3%] after adding cysteine and methionine, respectively). Lastly, the released 35SO42? was reutilised by microorganisms. The amount of 14CO2 and 35SO42? released from methionine was much lower than that from cysteine. The addition of excess glucose-C or inorganic nitrogen and S had little effect on cysteine and methionine uptake rate, but had a major effect on microbial C use efficiency (CUE) and internal S partitioning and the subsequent release of SO42?. We conclude that the microbial community cycles S-containing amino acids at a high rate, irrespective of soil S and N status with a large proportion of the C used in catabolic processes. ",

        "Comment": "The combination of concurrent soil degradation and restoration scenarios in a long-term experiment with contrasting treatments under steady-state conditions, similar soil texture and climate make the Highfield land-use change experiment at Rothamsted Research unique. We used soil from this experiment to quantify rates of change in organic matter (OM) fractions and soil structural stability (SSS) six years after the management changed. Soil degradation included the conversion of grassland to arable and bare fallow management, while soil restoration comprised introduction of grassland in arable and bare fallow soil. Soils were tested for clay dispersibility measured on two macro-aggregate sizes (DispClay 1\u20132 mm and DispClay 8\u201316 mm) and clay-SOM disintegration (DI, the ratio between clay particles retrieved without and with SOM removal). The SSS tests were related to soil organic carbon (SOC), permanganate oxidizable C (POXC) and hot water-extractable C (HWC). The decrease in SOC after termination of grassland was greater than the increase in SOC when introducing grassland. In contrast, it was faster to restore degraded soil than to degrade grassland soil with respect to SSS at macro-aggregate scale. The effect of management changes was more pronounced for 8\u201316 mm than 1\u20132 mm aggregates indicating a larger sensitivity towards tillage-induced breakdown of binding agents in larger aggregates. At microscale, SSS depended on SOC content regardless of management. Soil management affected macroscale structural stability beyond what is revealed from measuring changes in OM fractions, underlining the need to include both bonding and binding mechanisms in the interpretation of changes in SSS induced by management.",

        "Comment": "Earthworms are primary candidates for national soil health monitoring as they are ecosystem engineers that benefit both food production and ecosystem services associated with soil security. Supporting farmers to monitor soil health could help to achieve the policy aspiration of sustainable soils by 2030 in England; however, little is known about how to overcome participation barriers, appropriate methodologies (practical, cost-effective, usefulness) or training needs. This paper presents the results from a pilot #60minworms study which mobilised farmers to assess over >1300 ha farmland soils in spring 2018. The results interpretation framework is based on the presence of earthworms from each of the three ecological groups at each observation (20 x 20 cm x 20 cm pit) and spatially across a field (10 soil pits). Results showed that most fields have basic earthworm presence and abundance, but 42% fields may be over-worked as indicated by absence/rarity of epigeic and/or anecic earthworms. Tillage had a negative impact (p < 0.05) on earthworm populations and organic matter management did not mitigate tillage impacts. In terms of farmer participation, Twitter and Farmers Weekly magazine were highly effective channels for recruitment. Direct feedback from participants included excellent scores in trust, value and satisfaction of the protocol (e.g. 100% would do the test again) and 57% would use their worm survey results to change their soil management practices. A key training need in terms of earthworm identification skills was reported. The trade-off between data quality, participation rates and fieldwork costs suggests there is potential to streamline the protocol further to #30minworms (5 pits), incurring farmer fieldwork costs of approximately 1.48 pound ha(-1). At national scales, 14 pound million pounds across 4.7 M ha(-1) in fieldwork costs per survey could be saved by farmer participation.",

        "Comment": "A recent report of widespread declines in soil organic C (SOC) in the UK over the 10-25 years until the early 2000s has focussed attention on the importance of resampling previously characterized sites to assess long-term trends in SOC contents and the importance of soils as a potentially volatile and globally significant reservoir of terrestrial C. We have used two sets of long-term experimental plots which have been under constant and known management for over a century and for which historical data exist that allow comparison over recent decades to determine what, if any, changes in SOC content have occurred. The plots used are the Palace Leas (PL) Meadow Hay Plots in north-east England (UK) established in 1897, and from the Park Grass (PG) Continuous Hay experiment established in 1856 at Rothamsted in south-east England. Collectively, these plots represent the only grassland sites in the UK under long-term management where changes in SOC over several decades can be assessed, and are probably unique in the world. The plots have received different manure and fertilizer treatment and have been under known management for at least 100 years. In 1982, total SOC contents were determined for the 0-27 cm layer of six of the PL plots using measurements of SOC concentrations, bulk density and soil depth. In 2006, the same six PL plots were resampled and SOC contents determined again. Four of the plots showed no net change in SOC content, but two plots showed net loss of SOC of 15% and 17% (amounting to decreases of 18 and 15 t C ha(-1)) since 1982. However, these differences in total SOC content were in a similar range to the variations in bulk density (6-31%) with changing soil water content. In 1959, the soil masses and SOC concentrations to 23 cm depth were measured on six PG plots with fertilizer and manure treatments corresponding closely with those measured on PL. In 2002, the SOC concentrations on the same plots were measured again. On three of the PG plots, SOC concentrations had declined by 2-10%, but in the other three it had increased by 4-8% between 1959 and 2002. If it is assumed that the soil bulk density had not changed over this period, the losses of SOC from the top soils ranged range from 10 to 3 t C ha(-1), while the gains ranged from 4 to 7 t C ha(-1). When the differences with time in SOC contents for the six PL and the six PG plots were examined using paired t-tests, that is, regarding the plots as two sets of six replicate permanent grasslands, there were no significant differences between 1982 and 2006 for the PL plots or between 1959 and 2002 for the PG plots. Thus, these independent observations on similar plots at PL and PG indicate there has been no consistent decrease in SOC stocks in surface soils under old, permanent grassland in England in recent decades, even though meteorological records for both sites indicate significant warming of the soil and air between 1980 and 2000. Because the potential influences of changes in management or land use have been definitively excluded, and measured rather than derived bulk densities have been used to convert from SOC concentrations to SOC amounts, our observations question whether for permanent grassland in England, losses in SOC in recent decades reported elsewhere can be attributed to widespread environmental change.",

        "Comment": "While soil microbial ecology, soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil physical quality are widely understood to be interrelated \u2014 the underlying drivers of emergent properties, from land management to biochemistry, are hotly debated. Biological binding agents, microbial exudates, or \u2018extracellular polymeric substances\u2019 (EPS) in soil are now receiving increased attention due to several of the existing methodological challenges having been overcome. We applied a recently developed approach to quantify soil EPS, as extracellular protein and extracellular polysaccharide, on the well-characterised soils of the Highfield Experiment, Rothamsted Research, UK. Our aim was to investigate the links between agricultural land use, SOC, transient binding agents known as EPS, and their impacts on soil physical quality (given by mean weight diameter of water stable aggregates; MWD). We compared the legacy effects from long-term previous land-uses (unfertilised grassland, fertilised arable, and fallow) which were established > 50 years prior to investigation, crossed with the same current land-uses established for a duration of only 2.5 years prior to sampling. Continuously fallow and grassland soils represented the poorest and greatest states of structural integrity, respectively. Total SOC and N were found to be affected by both previous and current land-uses, while extractable EPS and MWD were driven primarily by the current land-use. Land-use change between these two extremes (fallow ? grass; grass ? fallow) resulted in smaller SOC differences (64% increase or 37% loss) compared to MWD (125% increase or 78% loss). SOC concentration correlated well to MWD (adjusted R2 = 0.72) but the greater SOC content from previous grassland was not found to contribute directly to the current stability (p < 0.05). Our work thus supports the view that certain distinct components of SOC, rather than the total pool, have disproportionately important effects on a soil\u2019s structural stability. EPS-protein was more closely related to aggregate stability than EPS-polysaccharide (p values of 0.002 and 0.027, respectively), and ranking soils with the 5 greatest concentrations of EPS-protein to their corresponding orders of stability (MWD) resulted in a perfect match. We confirmed that both EPS-protein and EPS-polysaccharide were transient fractions: supporting the founding models for aggregate formation. We suggest that management of transient binding agents such as EPS \u2014as opposed to simply increasing the total SOC content\u2014 may be a more feasible strategy to improve soil structural integrity and help achieve environmental objectives.",

        "Comment": "The effects of soil organic matter on the water contents for tillage were investigated by sampling soils with a uniform texture, but a range of soil organic carbon (SOC) from two long-term field experiments at Highfield in Rothamsted Research, UK and Askov Experimental Station, Denmark. The treatments studied in Highfield were Bare fallow (BF), Continuous arable rotation (A), Ley-arable (LA) and Grass (G); and in Askov: unfertilized (UNF), \u00bd mineral fertilizer (\u00bd NPK), 1 mineral fertilizer (1NPK), and 1\u00bd animal manure (1\u00bdAM). Minimally disturbed soil cores (100?cm3) were sampled per plot in both locations from 6 to 10?cm depth to generate water retention data. Soil blocks were also sampled at 6\u201315?cm depth to determine basic soil properties and to measure soil aggregate strength parameters. The range of soil water contents appropriate for tillage were determined using the water retention and the consistency approaches. SOC content in Highfield was in the order: G?>?LA?=?A?>?BF, and in Askov: 1\u00bd AM?>?1NPK?=?\u00bdNPK?>?UNF. Results showed that different long-term management of the silt loam Highfield soil, and fertilization of the sandy loam Askov soil affected the mechanical properties of the soils\u2014 for Highfield soil, aggregates from the G treatment were stronger in terms of rupture energy when wet (?100?hPa matric potential) than the BF treatment. As the soil dried (?300 and ?1000?hPa matric potentials), soil aggregates from the G treatment were relatively weaker and more elastic than the BF soil. Our study showed, for both Highfield and Askov soils, a strong positive linear increase in the range of water contents for tillage with increasing contents of SOC. This suggests that management practices leading to increased SOC can improve soil workability by increasing the range of water contents for tillage. We recommended using the consistency approach over the water retention approach for determining the range of water contents for tillage because it seems to give realistic estimates of the water contents for tillage.",

        "Comment": "Soil organic matter is important in relation to soil fertility, sustainable agricultural systems, and crop productivity, and there is concern about the level of organic matter in many soils, particularly with respect to global warming. Longterm experiments since 1843 at Rothamsted provide the longest data sets on the effect of soil, crop, manuring, and management on changes in soil organic matter under temperate climatic conditions. The amount of organic matter in soil depends on the input of organic material, its rate of decomposition, the rate at which existing soil organic matter is mineralized, soil texture, and climate. All four factors interact so that the amount of soil organic matter changes, often slowly, toward an equilibrium value specific to the soil type and farming system. For any one cropping system, the equilibrium level of soil organic matter in a clay soil will be larger than that in a sandy soil, and for any one soil type the value will be larger with permanent grass than with continuous arable cropping. Trends in long-term crop yields show that as yield potential has increased, yields are often larger on soils with more organic matter compared to those on soils with less. The effects of nitrogen, improvements in soil phosphorus availability, and other factors are discussed. Benefits from building up soil organic matter are bought at a cost with large losses of both carbon and nitrogen from added organic material. Models for the buildup and decline of soil organic matter, the source and sink of carbon dioxide in soil, are presented.",

        "Comment": "The Park Grass experiment (PGE) in the UK has been ongoing since 1856. Its purpose is to study the response of biological communities to the long-term treatments and associated changes in soil parameters, particularly soil pH. In this study, soil samples were collected across pH gradient (pH 3.6-7) and a range of fertilizers (nitrogen as ammonium sulfate, nitrogen as sodium nitrate, phosphorous) to evaluate the effects nutrients have on soil parameters and microbial community structure. Illumina 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) amplicon sequencing was used to determine the relative abundances and diversity of bacterial and archaeal taxa. Relationships between treatments, measured soil parameters, and microbial communities were evaluated. Clostridium, Bacteroides, Bradyrhizobium, Mycobacterium, Ruminococcus, Paenibacillus, and Rhodoplanes were the most abundant genera found at the PGE. The main soil parameter that determined microbial composition, diversity, and biomass in the PGE soil was pH. The most probable mechanism of the pH impact on microbial community may include mediation of nutrient availability in the soil. Addition of nitrogen to the PGE plots as ammonium sulfate decreases soil pH through increased nitrification, which causes buildup of soil carbon, and hence increases C/N ratio. Plant species richness and plant productivity did not reveal significant relationships with microbial diversity; however, plant species richness was positively correlated with soil microbial biomass. Plants responded to the nitrogen treatments with an increase in productivity and a decrease in the species richness.",

        "Comment": "Background and aims Soil degradation is a major global problem; to investigate the potential for recovery of soil biota and associated key functions, soils were monitored during the early years of conversion between permanent grassland, arable cropping and bare fallow (maintained by regular tilling). Distinct differences in soil properties had become apparent 50 years after a previous conversion. Methods Subplots on previously permanent grassland, arable and bare fallow soil were converted to the two alternatives, generating 9 treatments. Soil properties (soil organic carbon, mesofauna, microbial community structure and activity) were measured. Results After 2 years, mesofauna and microbial abundance increased where plants were grown on previously bare fallow soils and declined where grassland was converted to bare fallow treatment. Overall prokaryote community composition remained more similar to the previous treatments of the converted plots than to the new treatments but there were significant changes in the relative abundance of some groups and functional genes. Four years after conversion, SOC in arable and bare fallow soils converted to grassland had increased significantly. Conclusions Conversion to permanent grassland effectively replenished C in previously degraded soil; the soil microbiome showed significant conversion-related changes; plant-driven recovery was quicker than C loss in the absence of plants.",

We examined the effect of removing soil organic matter (SOM) by H2O2 before soil dispersion and determination of clay and silt. Soil samples with gradients in SOM were retrieved from three long-term field experiments each with uniform soil mineralogy and texture. For soils with less than 2 g C 100 g-1 minerals, clay estimates were little affected by SOM. Above this threshold, underestimation of clay increased dramatically with increasing SOM content. Silt contents were systematically overestimated when SOM was not removed; no lower SOM threshold was found for silt, but the overestimation was more pronounced for finer textured soils. When exact estimates of soil particles <20 ?m are needed, SOM should always be removed before soil dispersion. ",

        "Comment": "We propose the soil strength and air capacity (SSAC) approach, which was compared with alternative water retention curve (WRC) and the soil consistency (SC) approaches for estimating the water content at wet tillage limit (?WTL), optimum water content for tillage (?OPT) and the water content at the dry tillage limit (?DTL). Unlike the WRC and SC approaches, the SSAC approach uses a fixed value of air-filled porosity and tensile strength of soil aggregates to determine the wet and dry tillage limits: ?WTL is estimated as soil water content at an air-filled porosity of 0.10?m3?m\u20133, and ?DTL as soil water content at tensile strength of 50?kPa. The ?OPT is estimated using the double-exponential model as soil water content at the local minimum of the pore size distribution between the peaks of the textural and structural pores. The three approaches were compared using soils from the Highfield long-term field experiment (UK) with a range of soil organic carbon (SOC, 0.009\u20130.033?kg kg\u20131), and soil from Lerbjerg (DK) with a range of clay contents (0.12\u20130.45?kg kg\u20131). Workable days for the soils in spring and autumn between 2014 and 2018 was estimated using a decision support tool for assessing soil workability. Workability was limited where soil conditions were either too wet (>?WTL) or too dry (<?DTL). For both Highfield and Lerbjerg soils, ?WTL for the SC approach was generally drier than that for WRC and SSAC approaches. The number of workable days per season were influenced by SOC and clay contents. Soil with higher SOC had average of 36 and 23 workable days in the spring and the autumn, respectively, more than soil with low SOC. The number of workable days per season decreased with increasing clay content. Soil with lower clay had average of 21 and 25 workable days in the spring and the autumn, respectively, more than soil with high clay. The approach used for estimating ?WTL and ?DTL has impact on the number of workable days. For both soils studied, the number of workable days per season were more for WRC and SSAC approaches compared to the SC approach. While we believe the SSAC approach to be based on sound physical principles, further studies are needed to test the practical application of the SSAC approach for estimating ?WTL, ?DTL and workable days on more soils.",

        "Comment": "Plants provide the primary carbon source for soil communities, but there are few studies on the consequences of their absence over an extended period. It is unclear whether a reduction in the number of organisms associated with diminishing resources is associated with a reduction in their diversity. To investigate this, soil organic carbon (SOC), microbial and mesofaunal communities in the Highfield Ley-Arable Experiment at Rothamsted Research were compared. Samples were taken from an old grass sward, a section converted to arable rotation 60 years ago, and a section regularly tilled to maintain a bare fallow for the past 50 years. Microbial biomass is positively correlated with SOC regardless of the specific composition of the carbon, but the diversity of the community does not appear to be influenced by these parameters. In contrast, the abundance and diversity of the soil mesofauna are strongly influenced by recent plant inputs. On the fallow plot, the virtual elimination of fresh carbon inputs results in the degradation of SOC and reduction in microbial and mesofaunal numbers. However, the plot supports a species-rich and metabolically active bacterial community that is not significantly reduced in diversity compared to soil under arable cultivation or maintained as grass.",

        "Comment": "The effect of short leys and arable cropping on the yields of the following arable crops has been tested since 1937 at Woburn Experimental Farm, Bedfordshire. The leys were a 3-year grazed ley and 3 years of lucerne cut for hay and the arable cropping was potatoes, winter cereal and either a 1-year ley or a third tillage crop. The effects of these crop sequences were measured by test crops of potatoes and barley, uniformly treated except that 15 tons farmyard manure was applied on one-half of each plot for potatoes.Without farmyard manure, the yield of potatoes after the grazed ley was higher than after three tillage crops by an average of about 3 tons per acre; after lucerne it was about 2 tons per acre more than after the tillage crops and after the 1 -year ley under 1 ton per acre more. With farmyard manure the benefit from leys was less (about 2 tons per acre for both lucerne and the grazed ley). The average effect of the farmyard manure was about 2\u00b78 tons except after the grazed ley, where the increase was only 1\u00b76 tons per acre.Effects of the previous cropping on the yield of barley were small in the early years of the experiment, but in the last 5 years the yield after ley and lucerne has exceeded that after the tillage crops by about 15%.Part of the difference in potato yield between the ley and arable sequences can be attributed to the differential incidence of potato-root eelworm, which has reached a high level of infestation on some of the arable plots. Much of the remainder may be ascribed to the low level of basal manuring which has affected the yield of all plots, but particularly those under tillage crops. How far the observed differences can be explained by these considerations remains a matter for speculation, but may to some extent be clarified when further results are obtained from a revised scheme of cropping and manuring.",

        "Comment": "The Park Grass Experiment (PGE), begun at Rothamsted Experimental Station in 1856 and still running, affords a unique opportunity to test for the influence of species number and soil reaction on biomass variability in a suite of comparable plant communities. Biomass variability was measured by calculating the coefficient of variation (CV) over time of annual hay yield in an eleven-year moving window. CV and species number were both strongly negatively correlated with biomass; both relations were affected by time and pH. Multiple regression of CV on species number and mean biomass for non- acidified plots in 42 years between 1862 and 1991 showed a relationship between biomass and CV which was negative in most years and significantly so in nearly three quarters of them (30/42). We are unable to tell how much of this effect is intrinsic to the statistical relation between the mean and CV of biomass. Species number was negatively correlated with CV in 29/42 years, but this was statistically significant on only three occasions. Because this relation was highly significant in the year (1991) for which we have the largest sample size (34 plots), we tentatively conclude that biomass variability may be lower in more species-rich communities, although the effect is possibly a weak one. We suggest that physiological stresses imposed by low pH may explain the greater variability of plots with acidified soil. An increase in the variability of biomass that occurred across plots with time may be due in part to acidification across the whole experiment. Three hypotheses are proposed to explain the relationship between species richness and biomass variability: (i) biomass variability on more species-rich plots is better buffered against climatic variation because species differ in their response to climatic conditions: (ii) there are fewer species on plots with greater biomass variability because species have been lost by competitive exclusion in years when biomass reaches high values; (iii) species richness and variability are both correlated with a third variable, for example soil moisture deficit within a plot. All three hypotheses are susceptible to testing within the PGE.",

        "Comment": "The sequestration of carbon (C) in soil is not completely understood, and quantitative information about the amounts of organic carbon in the various fractions and their rates of turnover could improve understanding. We aimed (i) to quantify the amounts of C derived from maize at various depths in the soil in a long-term field experiment with and without fertilization using (13) C/(12) C analysis, (ii) to model changes in the organic C, and (iii) to compare measured and modelled pools of C. The organic C derived from the maize was measured in soil samples collected to a depth of 65 cm from four plots, two of which had been under continuous maize and two under continuous rye during long-term field experiments with NPK and without fertilization. The fractionation procedures included particle-size fractionation and extractions in water and in pyrophosphate solution. We used the Rothamsted Carbon Model to model the dynamics of the carbon from (13) C data. The amounts of C derived from maize in the Ap horizon after 39 years of continuous maize cropping were 9.5% of the total organic C (where unfertilized) and 14.0% where NPK had been applied. Fertilization did not affect the residence time of carbon in the soil. The amounts of C derived from maize in water extracts were 21% of the total organic C (where unfertilized) and 22% where NPK had been applied. The extracts that were soluble in pyrophosphate and insoluble in acid were depleted in C from maize (the amounts were 5% and 7% of the total organic C, respectively). The results of the (13) C natural abundance technique were used to model the dynamics of the organic C. Both the total organic C and the C derived from maize in the particle-size fraction 0-63 mum agreed well with the total and maize-derived sums of the model pools 'inert organic matter', 'humified organic matter' and 'microbial biomass'. The model suggested that 64% (unfertilized) or 53% (NPK) of the organic C in the Ap horizon were inert. Only one of three published equations to determine the size of the inert pool agreed well with these model results.",

        "Comment": "Archived wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain and straw, and soil samples from the control plot of the Rothamsted Broadbalk Experiment, located in southeastern England and established in 1843, were used to investigate the effects of dramatically changing SO2 Pollution inputs on the concentrations and stable isotope ratios (delta(34)S) of S in the samples. Representative coal samples from UK major coal fields were also determined for delta(34)S. Concentrations of S showed no clear trends in either grain or straw over the 155 years from 1845 to 1999. However, grain and straw VS decreased rapidly from 6 to 7parts per thousand in 1845 to -2 to -5parts per thousand in the early 1970s, and since then have increased to 0.5 to 2parts per thousand in the late 1990s. This pattern mirrored the trend of UK SO2 emissions over the 155 years. Both grain and straw delta(34)S correlated strongly and negatively with UK SO2 emissions (R-2 > 0.89), but the relationships were different for the pre- and post-1970 data sets. Soil VS also decreased considerably, from 8.2parts per thousand in 1865 to 3.7 to 4.5parts per thousand during 1965-1999. A negative delta(34)S value was inferred for the anthropogenic S deposited at the experimental site before 1970, and further confirmed by negative delta(34)S values (-6 to -10parts per thousand) found in the coal samples from southeastern England and southern Wales. Based on the S isotope ratios, we estimated that anthropogenic S contributed 62 to 78% of the S uptake by wheat at the peak Of SO2 emissions, and accounted for 28 to 37% of the topsoil S in 1965.",

        "Comment": "If soil communities rely on plant-derived carbon, is biodiversity lost when this primary source is removed? Soil microbial and mesofaunal communities at the Rothamsted Highfield site were compared under a mixed grass sward, arable rotation and a section maintained as a bare-fallow for the past 50 years by regular tillage. Organic matter reserves have been degraded and microbial and mesofaunal numbers and mite diversity have declined in this unique bare-fallow site, where fresh carbon inputs have been drastically reduced. However, it supports a species-rich metabolically active bacterial community of similar diversity to that in soil maintained as grass sward. Thus in contrast to soil mesofauna, bacterial diversity (but not abundance) is apparently independent of plant inputs.",

Plant canopy stomatal conductance is a key player in these coupled cycles: it is a physiological control of vegetation water use efficiency (the ratio of C gain by photosynthesis to water loss by transpiration), and it responds to photosynthetic activity, which is influenced by vegetation N status. It is unknown if the ca-increase and climate change over the last century have already affected canopy stomatal conductance and its links with C and N processes in grassland.",

        "Comment": "The soil ecosystem is critical for human health, affecting aspects of the environment from key agricultural and edaphic parameters to critical influence on climate change. Soil has more unknown biodiversity than any other ecosystem. We have applied diverse DNA extraction methods coupled with high throughput pyrosequencing to explore 4.88*10 9bp of metagenomic sequence data from the longest continually studied soil environment (Park Grass experiment at Rothamsted Research in the UK). Results emphasize important DNA extraction biases and unexpectedly low seasonal and vertical soil metagenomic functional class variations. Clustering-based subsystems and carbohydrate metabolism had the largest quantity of annotated reads assigned although <50% of reads were assigned at an E value cutoff of 10 -5. In addition, with the more detailed subsystems, cAMP signaling in bacteria (3.240.27% of the annotated reads) and the Ton and Tol transport systems (1.690.11%) were relatively highly represented. The most highly represented genome from the database was that for a Bradyrhizobium species. The metagenomic variance created by integrating natural and methodological fluctuations represents a global picture of the Rothamsted soil metagenome that can be used for specific questions and future inter-environmental metagenomic comparisons. However, only 1% of annotated sequences correspond to already sequenced genomes at 96% similarity and E values of <10 -5, thus, considerable genomic reconstructions efforts still have to be performed.",

        "Comment": "Global plant sulphur (S) deficiency is increasing because of a reduction in sulphate-based fertiliser application combined with continuous S withdrawal during harvest. Here, we applied 13C, 15N, 14C, and 35S quad labelling of the S-containing amino acids cysteine (Cys) and methionine (Met) to understand S cycling and microbial S transformations in the soil. The soil microorganisms absorbed the applied Cys and Met within minutes and released SO42? within hours. The SO42? was reutilised by the MB within days. The initial microbial utilisation and SO42? release were determined by amino acid structure. Met released 2.5-fold less SO42? than Cys. The microbial biomass retained comparatively more C and S from Met than Cys. The microorganisms decomposed Cys to pyruvate and H2S whereas they converted Met to ?-ketobutyrate and S-CH3. The microbial stoichiometries of C, N, and S derived from Cys and Met were balanced after 4 d by Cys-derived SO42? uptake and Met-derived CO2 release. The microbial C:N:S ratio dynamics showed rapid C utilisation and loss, stable N levels, and S accumulation. Thus, short-term organic S utilisation by soil microorganisms is determined by amino acid structure whilst long-term organic S utilisation by soil microorganisms is determined by microbially controlled stoichiometry.",

        "Comment": "We report the successful amplification of microsatellite markers for the chloroplast genome from century-old samples of 2 grasses growing in the Park Grass Experiment (PGE): Anthoxanthum ordoratum and Festuca rubra. This opens the possibility of establishing a long-term genetic time series for the PGE, which began in 1856 and is believed to be the oldest ecological experiment in existence. Although the plant samples used were not originally prepared or stored with molecular analysis in mind, the hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method of DNA extraction was successfully used. Obtained DNA was degraded but could be amplified by means of PCR. It produced bands around the expected size for chloroplast microsatellite primers derived from rice. When sequenced, bands showed good homology with sequences from rice chloroplast genomes listed in GenBank (accession No X15901).",

        "Comment": "Sugar has formed an essential part of human diets for a long time and is an important raw material for the food, beverage and pharmaceutical industries. It is a common name for sucrose and can be extracted from two field crops\u2014sugar beet and sugar cane. Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris ssp. vulgaris) is mainly grown in countries with temperate climates while sugar cane (Saccharum officinarum L.) is cultivated primarily in tropical and subtropical countries. It was demonstrated that sugar beet yield has kept increasing since 1926, but sugar concentration (on fresh weight basis) has not changed much. In the meantime, the improved potential sugar beet yields in the varieties included in the variety trials have been rapidly translated into commercially delivered yields by sugar beet farmers. This can be seen in the increase of farmer-delivered sugar beet yields in parallel with the increase of sugar beet yields in the variety trials. The warming temperature and increasing concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere due to climate change have benefitted the sugar beet crop in recent decades and will probably create opportunities to further boost sugar crop productivity in the future. However, social and environmental demands to adapt sugar beet production to both less input-intensive and less pesticide-dependent cropping systems to mitigate climate change and to maintain biodiversity friendly environments require sugar beet farmers to balance the trade-offs between maximising the sugar yield and increasing the use efficiencies of inputs such as fertilisers, fungicides, pesticides, herbicides and fuels. Sugar beet breeders and other stakeholders need to breed climate-smart cultivars resistant to diseases and find other effective non-chemical solutions to the reduced availability and/or removal of reliable pesticides in the face of more new pathogens emerging under climate change.",

        "Comment": "Sulfonates are major soil sulfur components that can be desulfurized by certain soil-borne bacteria as a sulfur source, but application of sulfate through fertilization could affect this natural sulfur mobilizing process. This study investigates the effects of sulfate treatments on bacterial communities in seminatural grasslands. Agrostis stolonifera-dominated turfs with their autochthonous bacteria from Woburn Experimental Farm, UK, were incubated with and without additional sulfate over a period of eight weeks and compared to soil and rhizosphere samples taken from the field directly. Cultivable rhizobacteria able to desulfurize toluenesulfonate were dominated by strains affiliated to the Variovorax, Polaromonas and Rhodococcus genera. The betaproteobacteria communities (16S rRNA gene-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) and the desulfonating bacterial communities (asfA based terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism) revealed clear differences between field rhizospheres and bulk soil and the two types of incubated rhizospheres. Clone libraries of asfA from the sulfate-limited treatment were dominated by a new AsfA type, affiliated to Polaromonas. The results from this study suggest that the community of desulfonating bacteria in the Agrostis rhizosphere adapts quickly to changing levels of inorganic sulfate. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

        "Comment": "Organically bound sulfur makes up about 90% of the total sulfur in soils, with sulfonates often the dominant fraction. Actinobacteria affiliated to the genus Rhodococcus were able to desulfonate arylsulfonates in wheat rhizospheres from the Broadbalk long-term field wheat experiment, which includes plots treated with inorganic fertilizer with and without sulfate, with farmyard manure, and unfertilized plots. Direct isolation of desulfonating rhizobacteria yielded Rhodococcus strains which grew well with a range of sulfonates, and contained the asfAB genes, known to be involved in sulfonate desulfurization by bacteria. Expression of asfA in vitro increased > 100-fold during growth of the Rhodococcus isolates with toluenesulfonate as sulfur source, compared with growth with sulfate. By contrast, the closely related Rhodococcus erythropolis and Rhodococcus opacus type strains had no desulfonating activity and did not contain asfA homologues. The overall actinobacterial community structure in wheat rhizospheres was influenced by the sulfur fertilization regime, as shown by specific denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of PCR amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments, and asfAB clone library analysis identified nine different asfAB genotypes closely affiliated to the Rhodococcus isolates. However, asfAB-based multiplex restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)/terminal-RFLP analysis of wheat rhizosphere communities revealed only slight differences between the fertilization regimes, suggesting that the desulfonating Rhodococcus community does not specifically respond to changes in sulfate supply.",

        "Comment": "Lead-210 chronologies, vertical S concentration gradients and delta(34)S values are presented for 5 Sphagnum-dominated peat bogs located in Central Europe (Rybarenska slat and Ocean Bog; Czech Republic) and the British Isles (Thorne Moors, England; Connemara, Ireland; and Mull, Scotland). Sulfur concentrations were measured in three 40-cm deep peat cores per site, sectioned into 2-cm segments. The coefficient of variation in S concentrations was low across all depths and sites (mean of 16%), indicating a high degree of within-site homogeneity in vertical S patterns. Similar S concentration trends and similar delta(34)S trends were found at all study sites. With an increasing peat depth, S concentrations first increased and then decreased. S concentrations peaked in layers which were deposited in ca. 1959, 1907, 1945, 1899 and 1799 at Rybarenska slat, Ocean, Thorne Moors, Connemara and Mull, respectively. Atmospheric S deposition peaked in 1972 in the UK and in 1987 in the Czech Republic. Due to downward S mobility in peat, S concentration maxima were found in layers 59 ( 19) a older that the year of the actual peak in S input. With an increasing depth, the maturating peat substrate at all sites exhibited first a negative delta(34)S shift, resulting from dissimilatory bacterial SO4 reduction, and then a positive delta(34)S shift, which may be related to advancing S mineralization. Minimum delta(34)S values were detected in layers which were deposited in ca. 1988, 1982, 1945, 1940 and 1978. A comparison of historical delta(34)S signatures of atmospheric S in England, measured on archived grain from the Broadbalk experiment (18451994), with delta(34)S values of Thorne Moors peat (1830-1994) also indicated mobility of S in peat. Sulfur mobility in water-logged peat is of concern during the present period of easing industrial pollution because SO4 released from peat-lands may increase the acidity of the output.

        "Comment": "Sulphur K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy was used to quantify S species in humic substance extracts from ten soils from the UK, China and New Zealand, which differ in land use and agricultural management. XANES spectroscopy showed the presence of most reduced (sulphides, disulphicles, thiols and thiophenes), intermediate (sulphoxides and sulphonates) and highly oxidised S (ester sulphates) forms, with the three groups representing 14-32%, 33-50% and 22-53% of the organic S in the humic substance extracts, respectively. Land use had a profound influence on the relative proportions of S species. Well-drained arable soils generally had a higher proportion of organic S present in the most oxidised form than the grassland soils collected nearby, whereas paddy soils showed a more reduced profile due to episodic flooding. In the Broadbalk Classical Experiment at Rothamsted, reversion of an arable system to grassland or woodland in the 1880s resulted in an increase of the most reduced and intermediate S species at the expense of the most oxidised S species. Long-term applications of farmyard manure to an arable plot also shifted S species from the most oxidised to the intermediate and the most reduced species. Sulphur immobilisation and gross mineralisation were determined in seven soils using the S-35 isotope dilution method. Gross mineralisation during a 53-day incubation correlated more closely with the amounts of the most reduced and intermediate S species than with the most oxidised S species, suggesting that the former (C-bonded S) were the main source of organic S for mineralisation in the short-term.

It comprises a menu-driven system that allows agricultural advisers, even with minimal computing experience, to enter details of a particular held or farm and simulate N turnover, The processes involved are described by a set of parameterized zero and first-order equations. The addition of a novel facility for calculating crop parameters enables instantaneous estimation of parameters for rough but immediate simulations of a new crop, graphical visualization of the expressions used in SUNDIAL, comparison of the parameterized expressions with experimental measurements, and further refinement of parameters by fitting individual expressions to measured data or by iteratively adjusting parameters to improve the fit of simulated results to soil and crop N and N-15 measurements. The facilities in SUNDIAL for displaying the various outputs in graphical form make it particularly useful for examining the impact of different management strategies on the N cycle in arable agriculture. Graphical facilities include balance sheets, graphical plots, pie charts, and flow diagrams.",

        "Comment": "Dried soil samples from many sources have been stored in archives world-wide over the years, but there has been little research on their value for studying microbial populations. Samples collected since 1843 from the Broadbalk field experiment on crop nutrition at Rothamsted have been used to document changes in the structure and composition of soils as agricultural practices evolve, also offering an invaluable record of environmental changes from the pre- to post-industrial era in the UK. To date, the microbial communities of these soils have not been studied, in part due to the well-documented drop in bacterial culturability in dried soils. However, modern molecular methods based on PCR amplification of DNA extracted directly from soil do not require bacterial cells to be viable or intact and may allow investigations into the legacy of bacteria that were present at the time of sample collection. In a preliminary study, to establish if dried soils can provide a historical record of bacterial communities, samples from the Broadbalk soil archive dating back to 1868 were investigated and plots treated with either farmyard manure (FYM) or inorganic fertilizer (NPK) were compared. As anticipated, the processes of air-drying and milling greatly reduced bacterial viability whilst DNA yields declined less and may be preserved by desiccation. A higher proportion of culturable bacteria survived the archiving process in the FYM soil, possibly protected by the increased soil organic matter. The majority of surviving bacteria were firmicutes, whether collected in 2003 or in 1914, but a wide range of genera was detected in DNA extracted from the samples using PCR and DGGE of 16S rRNA genes. Analysis of DGGE band profiles indicated that the two plots maintained divergent populations. Sequence analysis of bands excised from DGGE gels, from a sample collected in 1914, revealed DNA from alpha- and beta-proteobacteria as well as firmicutes. PCR using Primers specific for ammonia oxidizing bacteria showed similar band profiles across the two treatments in recently collected samples, however older samples from the NPK plot showed greater divergence. Primers specific for the genus Pseudomonas were designed and used in real-time quantitative PCR to indicate that archived soil collected in 1868 contained 10-fold less pseudomonad DNA than fresh soil, representing around 10(5) genomes g(-1) soil. Prior to milling, dramatically less pseudomonad DNA was extracted from recently collected air-dried soil from the NPK compared to the FYM plot; otherwise, the two plots followed similar trends. Overall bacterial abundance, diversity and survival during the archiving process differed in the two soils, possibly due to differences in clay and soil organic matter content. Nevertheless, the results demonstrate that air-dried soils can protect microbial DNA for more than 150 years and offer an invaluable resource for future research. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

        "URL": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1920405117 %X The stability of ecological communities under ongoing climate and land-use change is fundamental to the sustainable management of natural resources through its effect on critical ecosystem services. Biodiversity is hypothesized to enhance stability through compensatory effects (decreased synchrony between species). However, the relative importance and interplay between different biotic and abiotic drivers of stability remain controversial. By analyzing long-term data from natural and seminatural ecosystems across the globe, we found that the degree of synchrony among dominant species was the main driver of stability, rather than species richness per se. These biotic effects overrode environmental drivers, which influenced the stability of communities by modulating the effects of richness and synchrony. The stability of ecological communities is critical for the stable provisioning of ecosystem services, such as food and forage production, carbon sequestration, and soil fertility. Greater biodiversity is expected to enhance stability across years by decreasing synchrony among species, but the drivers of stability in nature remain poorly resolved. Our analysis of time series from 79 datasets across the world showed that stability was associated more strongly with the degree of synchrony among dominant species than with species richness. The relatively weak influence of species richness is consistent with theory predicting that the effect of richness on stability weakens when synchrony is higher than expected under random fluctuations, which was the case in most communities. Land management, nutrient addition, and climate change treatments had relatively weak and varying effects on stability, modifying how species richness, synchrony, and stability interact. Our results demonstrate the prevalence of biotic drivers on ecosystem stability, with the potential for environmental drivers to alter the intricate relationship among richness, synchrony, and stability.",

Phylogenetic variation in the ionomes of plant shoots has been widely reported based on controlled experiments, vegetation surveys and literature meta-analyses. However, environmental effects on phylogenetic variation in shoot ionomes have not been quantified. This study tests the hypothesis that phylogenetic variation in shoot ionomes is robust to environmental perturbation and that plant families can be distinguished by their shoot ionomes. Herbage was sampled from six subplots of the Rothamsted Park Grass Experiment. Subplots had received contrasting fertilizer treatments since 1856. Herbage was separated into its constituent species ( n=21) and concentrations of eleven mineral elements were determined in dried shoot material. Shoot concentrations of calcium (Ca), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), magnesium (Mg) and sodium (Na) showed significant variation associated with plant species, and responded similarly to fertilizer treatments in diverse plant species. Species * treatment interactions were indicated for phosphorus (P), potassium (K), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu) and iron (Fe). Plant families could be distinguished by their shoot ionomes. The most informative elements for discriminant analysis were Ca > Mg > Ni > S > Na > Zn > K > Cu > Fe > Mn > P. Whilst shoot ionomes were sensitive to fertilizer treatment, phylogenetic variation in a subset of the shoot ionome (Ca, Zn, Mn, Mg) was robust to this environmental perturbation.",

        "Comment": "Three field experiments in Eastern England, in which 15N-labelled fertilizer had been applied to winter wheat, were used to measure the persistence of the labelled N remaining in soil and stubble at harvest and the availability of this N to up to four subsequent wheat crops. A portion of the labelled fertilizer N quickly became stabilized in the soil, with only small and ever-decreasing amounts recovered by subsequent crops. Combining all sites, all years and all applications of fertilizer, 6\u00b76\u00b11\u00b792 (S.D.) % of the labelled fertilizer remaining in soil (0\u201370 cm) plus stubble in the year of application was taken up by the next wheat crop, i.e. by the first \u2018residual year\u2019 crop. A further 3\u00b75\u00b10\u00b739% was taken up in the second residual year, 2\u00b72\u00b10\u00b743% in the third and 2\u00b72% in the fourth. Loss of residual labelled N was more rapid from a sandy soil than from two heavier-textured soils, particularly in the first residual year. After four residual crops on one of the heavier soils (at Rothamsted), 16% of the labelled N remaining in soil (0\u201370 cm) and stubble in the year of application had been taken up by the crops, c. 29% had been lost from the soil/crop system and 55% remained in the soil.",

Cumulative K uptake by the first crop was linearly related with initial exchangeable K. The relationship between K uptake and the square root of time distinguished two categories of non-exchangeable K, the first was released rapidly and was well correlated with exchangeable K. Release of non-exchangeable K was about twice the decrease in exchangeable K. K added as fertilizer in 1964 increased exchangeable K in the soil by only 20% irrespective of the amount added. Results of the pot experiment when compared with a field experiment lasting 9 years confirm that grass grown in both experiments measured the same amounts and categories of soil K",

        "Comment": "The Broadbalk experiment was started in 1843 to investigate the relative importance of different plant nutrients (N, P, K, Na, Mg) on grain yield of winter wheat. Weeds were controlled initially by hand hoeing and fallowing, but since 1964, herbicides have been applied to the whole experiment with the exception of the 18 plots on Section 8. Approximately 130 weed species have been recorded on Broadbalk and about 30 of these are currently recorded annually on Section 8. Detailed weed surveys, conducted from 1930 to 1979, provide a unique 50-yr record, but the relatively small number of frequency categories used (six) poses a limitation on the interpretation of these data for ecological studies. Weed surveys were restarted in 1991 on Section 8. The current assessment method records the presence of individual 2 weed species in 25 random 0.1-m(2) quadrats per plot, which is more appropriate for detecting long-term trends in weed frequencies and population differences between plots. A principal components analysis of the 1991-2002 survey data for 15 species showed clearly the influence of inorganic N fertilizer levels on the frequency of individual species. The frequency of one species (common chickweed) was greatly favored by increasing amounts of nitrogen fertilizer from 0 to 288 kg N ha(-1), others were strongly disadvantaged (e.g., black medic and field horsetail), some were slightly disadvantaged (e.g., common vetch and parsley-piert), and some showed little response to differing N rates (e.g., blackgrass and corn poppy). Other weed investigations include studies on the effects of fallowing on the weed seed bank, seed dormancy and persistence, agroecology, and population dynamics of individual weed species. Recently, molecular approaches have been used to study the genetic diversity of weeds found on Section 8, which is one of the few arable sites in the country where herbicides have never been applied. This site also provides an invaluable reserve for seven nationally rare or uncommon species. Broadbalk continues to act as a valuable resource for weed investigations 160 yr after it was established.",

        "DOI": "Modifications made to the Broadbalk wheat experiment in 1968 included growing wheat in rotations of potatoes/beans [Vicia faba]/wheat and fallow/wheat/wheat. The major change in manuring was to apply all N in spring as Nitro-Chalk and introduce a test of 192 kg N/ha. Av. yields for all crops and all treatments during 1970-8 are given. Wheat yields were higher than at any time since 1843, even on soils unmanured since then. Wheat after beans gave the highest grain yield. Potatoes and wheat responded differently to unbalanced manuring. N response curves were fitted to the 1970-8 av. yields of wheat grown continuously, as 1st and 2nd crops after fallow and following beans. The curves for the 3 rotational wheats were brought into coincidence with that for continuous wheat by vertical and horizontal shifts. Relative to wheat grown continuously, the vertical shifts were equivalent to increased yields for wheat after beans (0.51 t/ha) and 2nd wheat after fallow (0.38 t/ha), but decreased yield for 1st wheat after fallow (-0.36 t/ha). The horizontal shifts were equivalent to increases in available N for wheat after beans (23 kg/ha) and 1st wheat after fallow (53 kg/ha), but a slight decrease for 2nd wheat after fallow (-9 kg/ha). N, P, K, Ca, Mg and Na contents in all the crops averaged over 1970-5 (1978 for N) and offtakes of these nutrients in the harvested crops are given. Wheat grain after beans and from continuous wheat contained, on av. 1.94 and 1.92% N in the DM, resp. Of the total offtake by wheat in grain plus straw the proportion in the grain was 82% for N, 85% for P, 44% for K, 16% for Ca, 71% for Mg and 40% for Na. Compared with earlier periods, grain N content had changed little but N offtakes were larger, because yield had increased, and apparent recoveries of fertilizer N had improved. Grain P content had decreased by c. 25% but offtakes were larger, again because yield had increased. There was little or no change in K content but there were large seasonal differences in straw K content. Ca, Mg and Na conc. in grain and straw had changed very little.",

        "Comment": "A range of spectroscopic, `wet' chemical, gas chromatographic (GC) and mass spectrometric (MS) techniques was applied to the characterisation of three soil organic matter (SOM) fractions that have been proposed as the basis. of a new SOM turnover model based on measurable, physically defined fractions. The fractions were: the free light fraction (obtained by density separation in NaI solution at a density of 1.80 g cm(-3), without disruption of aggregates), the intra-aggregate light fraction (obtained using a second density separation after disrupting aggregates using ultrasonic dispersion) and the organomineral fraction corresponding to the residual heavy material. The techniques employed to investigate the composition of the organic constituents of each fraction were: C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (py-GC/MS) to study bulk composition. Lipid, lignin and carbohydrate fractions were assessed using GC and GC/MS with appropriate derivatisation, following oxidative and hydrolytic treatments, respectively, in the case of the latter two classes. Proteinaceous components were determined as amino acids using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) following 6 M HCl treatment and derivatisation. Each technique revealed marked differences in chemical composition between the organomineral and the two light fractions with the results being consistent with the organomineral fraction having different biological sources or having undergone a greater degree of degradation or transformation. Several techniques detected differences between the composition of the free light fraction and the intra-aggregate light fraction. With the exception of carbohydrate composition, the results were consistent with the order of reactivity previously proposed from incubation studies with isotopically labelled substrates, namely: free > intra-aggregate > organomineral. The investigation illustrates the importance of using a range of different chemical characterisation techniques in studies of complex SOM fractions as each has limitations that could, if used alone, produce ambiguous findings or fail to detect differences between them.

The soil microbial biomass displays some highly conserved, and possibly unique, characteristics that do not permit a classic interpretation of microbial metabolic parameter data. The resilience of soil microbial biomass and the role of soil organic matter in sustaining microbial biomass under practically zero C inputs were assessed in two long term incubation experiments using soils from the Broadbalk experiment at Rothamsted (UK). Soils with low organic C contents, showed the greatest decline in biomass C during the first 30 d of incubation. The ATP concentration of this rapidly declining microbial biomass did not change during the prolonged incubation period, confirming this peculiar character of the soil microbial biomass. Specific respiration rate did not depend upon substrate availability, being higher in soils that had received the lowest C inputs. Qualitative and quantitative changes observed in humic fractions suggest that humified soil organic matter is a much more dynamic soil fraction than is normally considered and provides a utilizable energy reserve for soil microorganisms. Carbon levels can be successfully restored in soils through practices such as incorporation of crop residues, re-vegetation and application of manures, biosolids and composts. Some amendments, such as olive mill waste compost, promote incorporation of altered lignin structures, N-containing compounds and carbohydrates into humic acids. The mineral-bound fraction of humic C also increases, after their addition, and contributes to the accumulation of the most inert soil C pools.",

Several long-term studies in the USA, England, and the tropics, along with the results from an agricultural chemical use study and nutrient budget information, were evaluated. A total of 362 seasons of crop production were included in the long-term study evaluations. Crops utilized in these studies included corn (Zea mays L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merr.], rice (Oryza sativa L.), and cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.]. The average percentage of yield attributable to fertilizer generally ranged from about 40 to 60% in the USA and England and tended to be much higher in the tropics. Recently calculated budgets for N, P, and K indicate that commercial fertilizer makes up the majority of nutrient inputs necessary to sustain current crop yields in the USA. The results of this investigation indicate that the commonly cited generalization that at least 30 to 50% of crop yield is attributable to commercial fertilizer nutrient inputs is a reasonable, if not conservative estimate.",

        "Comment": "N-15-labelled ammonium nitrate was applied to spring barley growing on a Cambisol soil in western Switzerland. Immobilization, plant uptake and disappearance of inorganic nitrogen were followed at frequent intervals. Fertilizer nitrogen disappeared shortly after its application, mainly through immobilization by soil microorganisms and absorption by the crop. Some of the added nitrogen was probably denitrified as a result of humid conditions during the first days after fertilizer application. At the end of the growing season, 31% of the added nitrogen was recovered from the aerial barley plants. and 56% was immobilized by microorganisms. Most of the fertilizer nitrogen not used by the crop was immobilized in the upper 0-30 cm soil layer. This prevented downward movement of nitrate and limited nitrogen losses. Fertilizer efficiency was mainly determined by the competition between crop uptake and microbial immobilization. Careful consideration of the time of fertilization, taking into account plant growth and weather conditions, can result in an increase in fertilizer efficiency and minimal pollution. The changing populations of weeds during 13 years of the Broadbalk continuous wheat experiment were analysed to investigate the extent of differences in short-term variability of cover between species. The data were from two sections of the experiment where winter wheat was grown continuously under herbicide treatment for 13 and 6 years respectively. Logistic regressions were fitted to the data. Equisetum arvense showed significant long-term increases on both sections; long-term trends were also detected in the longer data run for Agrostis stolonifera, Cirsium arvensa, Poa trivialis, Ranunculus arvensis and Vicia sativa, and for Medicago lupulina on the shorter data run. Variation around long-term trends was low in the case of Equisetum, and, in the longer data run, for Cirsium and Tussilago farfara, and high for Poa spp. and Vicia. Cover values on the two sections were positively correlated for Alopecurus myosuroides, Equisetum, Poa annua and Tripleurospermum inodorum. There was a weak correlation between C-S-R strategy and short-term variability; the more competitive species displayed less variability than the ruderal species. Furthermore, species regenerating from persistent seed banks were more variable in the short term than those regenerating from short-lived seed or bud banks. This can be explained by differences in response to year-to-year variation in environmental conditions, those species with:persistent seed banks being typically more sensitive to annual fluctuations in the environment than those without.",

        "Comment": "Rotation experiments are intended to compare different sequences of crop (and possibly husbandry) combinations. To avoid the conclusions being dependent on a specific sequence of years, it is advantageous to phase the start of the experiment, with new replicates of the rotations starting in successive years. Once a complete cycle has taken place, comparisons can then be made between the rotations in every subsequent year. If sufficient resources are available to have more than one replicate in each year, it will be possible to do an interim analysis with the data from a single year. Otherwise meaningful analyses will need several years\u2019 data and the assumption, e.g., that higher order interactions can be ignored or that responses over years can be modeled by low-order polynomials. Other analysis complications are that the within-year variances may be unequal and that the correlation between observations on a plot may differ according to the distance in time between them. The old-fashioned method of analysis, feasible if the data are balanced, would be to do a repeated-measurements analysis of variance. A more recent, and more satisfactory, alternative is to do a mixed model analysis by residual (restricted) maximum likelihood estimation, possibly fitting a model to the between-year correlation structure. The issues are illustrated using data from the Woburn Ley\u2013Arable Experiment.",

        "Comment": "Community variability has a dual nature. On the one hand, there is compositional variability, changes in the relative abundance of component species. On the other hand, there is aggregate variability, changes in summary properties such as total abundance, biomass, or production. Although these two aspects of variability have received much individual attention, few studies have explicitly? related the compositional and aggregate variability of natural communities. In this paper, we show how simultaneous consideration of both aspects of community variability might advance our understanding of ecological communities. We use the distinction between compositional and aggregate variability to develop an organizational framework for describing patterns of community variability. At their extremes, compositional and aggregate variability combine in four different ways: (I) stasis, low compositional and low aggregate variability; (2) synchrony, low compositional and high aggregate variability; (3) asynchrony, high compositional and high aggregate variability; and (4) compensation, high compositional and low aggregate variability. Each of these patterns has been observed in natural communities, and can be linked to a suite of abiotic and biotic mechanisms. We give examples of the potential relevance of variability patterns to applied ecology, and describe the methodological developments needed to make meaningful comparisons of aggregate and compositional variability across communities. Finally, we provide two numerical examples of how our approach can be applied to natural communities.",

Data covering a period exceeding 80 yr are available to test for relationships between hay yield (biomass), spp. diversity, spp. number and time. Spp. diversity and spp. number showed negative relationships with plot biomass and with pH. These relationships were constant over time. The effect of biomass and pH on spp. number and spp. diversity were additive. Analysis of the flora of 9 plots, each divided into grasses, legumes and a miscellaneous component showed that these components were at equilibrium. The effect of various endogenous factors on this botanical equilibrium was examined. No regular or irregular cycles of component biomass operating between yr were detected and it was inferred that populations were regulated by processes operating within individual yr. The biomasses of all 3 components were positively correlated within an unfertilized plot but the floristic components of plots receiving a fertilizer treatment showed few within-plot correlations. By contrast between-plot correlations of components were common for all plots with the exception of those receiving N fertilizer. The mechanisms of population regulation which maintained the Park Grass ecosystem at equilibrium are discussed and tests for these are proposed.",

Problems (scientific, political, personal) in establishing long-term experiments and observation are highlighted. Three examples of long-term and synoptic studies are drawn from the work at the Rothamsted Experimental Station in Hertfordshire; the Broadbalk continuous wheat experiment, instigated in 1843; the Park Grass experiment, laid down in 1856; and the Rothamsted Insect Survey, which began in the early 1960s.

        "Comment": "Liming is a common management practice, but there exists uncertainty about the economic benefits. An economic analysis of the costs and profitability of liming arable crops was undertaken using data from the long-term liming experiment at Rothamsted and Woburn. There was a strong liming effect on gross margins, but large differences in the economic benefit between crops. For some crops (such as spring barley), liming greatly  improved the gross margin, while for spring oats liming provided very little increase. Most economic benefit was achieved with the high lime treatment, but the cumulative discounted cash flow indicated that it took approximately 20 years before a distinct difference developed between the lime treatments. Therefore, lime should be considered a capital investment and economic evaluation undertaken over a long period. Liming rate increased the net present value expressed as an annual equivalent (NPVa). An additional \u00a3436 ha?1 year?1 at Rothamsted and \u00a3208  ha?1  year?1 at Woburn of profit was gained from the adoption of the most profitable liming treatments over not liming. Sensitivity analysis indicated that total liming costs had a weak effect on NPVa, but crop price had a strong effect. The economic performance of liming differed between sites and was higher at Rothamsted than at Woburn, mostly because of soil differences. Liming greatly improves economic returns of most arable crops, but the magnitude of the long-term economic benefit depends upon the sequence of crops within a given rotation.",

        "Comment": "Aerobic soils are an important sink for methane (CH4) contributing up to 15% of annual global CH4 destruction. However, the sink strength is significantly affected by land management, nitrogen (N) fertilizers and acidity. We tested these effects on samples taken from the Broadbalk Continuous Wheat, Park Grass permanent grassland and Broadbalk and Geescroft Wilderness experiments at Rothamsted. The rates of uptake from the atmosphere of both enhanced (10 ppmv) and ambient (2 ppmv) concentrations of CH4 were measured in laboratory incubations of soil cores under controlled conditions. The most rapid rates of uptake were measured in soil from deciduous woodland at pH 7 (measured in water); acidic (pH 4) woodland soil showed no net CH4 oxidation. While disturbance of the cores used in the experiments did not affect the rate of CH4 uptake, extended (150 years) cultivation of land for arable crops reduced uptake rate by 85% compared to that in the soil under calcareous woodland. The long-term application of ammonium-(NH4) based fertilizer, but not nitrate-(NO3) based fertilizer, completely inhibited CH4 uptake, but the application for the same period of farmyard manure that contained more N than the fertilizer had no inhibitory effect. Although the effects of agricultural practice on the oxidation of CH4 in soil are significant, the differences in oxidation rates between land use types are even greater. The likely effects of forest clearance, agricultural intensification and anthropogenic emissions of CH4 over the last 2500 years have been estimated for the United Kingdom. The calculations indicate that 54% of the current CH4 uptake by UK soils is the result of increased CH4 mixing ratio. They also indicate that land use change has decreased the potential sink strength by 62% or 37 kt CH4 g(-1). In countries with much larger land areas than the UK, such as China, aerobic soil is likely to be a more significant factor in calculating net fluxes of CH4. It is important that the impacts of different agricultural managements and land use systems are understood and quantified so that the best possible estimate of CH4 sinks is calculated for comparison with sources.",

        "Comment": "Soil and plant samples have been taken at intervals from the permanent grassland of the Park Grass Experiment (begun in 1856) and from the deciduous woodland of the Broadbalk and Geescroft Wilderness Experiments (begun in the 1880's). The relative importance of atmospheric deposition to acid inputs and the effects of acid inputs on the composition and yield of grassland and woodland have been evaluated from a combination of precipitation chemistry and estimates of other inputs. Acid rain has been a negligible source of acidity throughout the 100 year period of the experiments. Total atmospheric deposition (including dry deposited SO2 and NOx) and NH4+ which may be nitrified, comprised up to 30% of the total acidifying inputs when soils were at or near pH 7 and up to 70% in more acid soils. Acidification slightly reduced the yield of herbage and the number of species present in grassland and the stand wt of woodland. Different tree species dominated acid woodland soils. There has been a greater acidification under deciduous woodland than under ungrazed grassland. The implications of a move in land use from agriculture to forestry or agroforestry are discussed.",

        "Comment": "In agricultural systems, soils are subjected to a range of stresses which may affect soil physical and biological properties and compromise the ability of the soil to function. How the soil responds to stress both initially and over time defines resistance and resilience respectively and is key to sustainable soil management. As soil organic matter (OM) is a fundamental soil property, we hypothesised that resilience would be controlled, in part, by this. As soil OM is itself affected by long-term soil management, we therefore sought to establish a direct link between this and resilience to physical and biological stresses. Fifteen soils were taken from a range of arable and grassland sites in England, including the Broadbalk and Highfield long-term experiments at Rothamsted. The soils were subjected to physical (uniaxial compaction stress) or biological (transient heat stress or persistent Cu stress) stresses in the laboratory and the effects on general physical (void ratio) and biological (substrate-induced respiration) functions were monitored over a recovery period of up to 28 days. Wet-dry and freeze-thaw cycles were also imposed on the soils following the initial recovery after compression. The initial recovery of void ratio following compression was greater in grassland soils (0.28-0.80) than arable soils (0.16-0.58) which was probably related to the elastic effect of particulate OM and the redistribution of the greater water content in the former soils. Wet-dry and freeze-thaw cycles had an additional effect in soils with clay contents greater than 26% The transient heat stress reduced respiration rates in the grassland soils by up to 45%. Grassland soils are less likely to have been subjected to heat stress in the field since they carry a greater vegetation covering than arable soils. The more persistent Cu stress reduced respiration rates in arable soils by up to 85% but only up to 30% in grassland soils. The difference was ascribed to the greater microbial biomass and diversity in grassland soils and buffering by the OM. We defined resistance and resilience indices as the absolute value of the measured soil functions at maximum stress and after the recovery period respectively. Reasonable linear regressions (adjusted R-2 up to 0.68) were established for resistance or resilience as a function of soil OM content used as a proxy index of soil management Expressed in this way, grassland soils were more resistant and resilient to the physical and biological stresses than the arable soils. Linear relationships were also found to link physical and biological resistance and resilience (adjusted R-2 up to 0.96). An arable soil with 65% clay was found to be highly resilient also. We found large differences in physical and biological resilience to stress between arable and grassland soils. We attributed this primarily to the effect of soil management on the OM content although we recognised the importance of clay content. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "Comment": "Amino acid delta N-15 values of barley (Hordeum vulgare) and bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) grains and rachis and broad bean (Vicia faba) and pea (Pisum sativum) seeds, grown in manured and unmanured soil at the experimental farm stations of Rothamsted, UK and Bad Lauchstadt, Germany, were determined by GC-C-IRMS. Manuring was found to result in a consistent N-15-enrichment of cereal grain amino acid delta N-15 values, indicating that manuring did not affect the metabolic routing of nitrogen (N) into cereal grain amino acids. The increase in cereal grain delta N-15 values with manuring is therefore due to a N-15-enrichment in the delta N-15 value of assimilated inorganic-N. Greater variation was observed in the N-15-enrichment of rachis amino acids with manuring, possibly due to enhanced sensitivity to changes in growing conditions and higher turnover of N in rachis cells compared to cereal grains. Total amino acid delta N-15 values of manured and unmanured broad beans and peas were very similar, indicating that the legumes assimilated N-2 from the atmosphere rather than N from the soil, since there was no evidence for routing of N-15-enriched manure N into any of the pulse amino acids. Crop amino acid delta N-15 values thus provide insights into the sources of N assimilated by non N-2-fixing and N-2-fixing crops grown on manured and unmanured soils, and reveal an effect of manure on N metabolism in different crop species and plant parts.

        "Comment": "We investigated the effect of soil organic carbon (SOC) on the consolidation behaviour of soil from two long term field experiments at Rothamsted; the Broadbalk Wheat Experiment and Hoosfield Spring Barley. These experiments are located on soil with similar particle size distributions, and include treatments with SOC contents ranging from approximately 1\u20133.5 g/100 g. Soils taken from plots with contrasting SOC contents were compressed and deformed in a triaxial cell and the normal consolidation and critical state lines were determined. We found that the compression index was independent of SOC, but the void ratio at any given effective stress was highly correlated with organic carbon content. By comparison with uniaxial compression data, the apparent influence of SOC on the compression index is likely to be due to its effect on soil hydraulic properties rather than any intrinsic effects of strength. The plastic limit test appears to be a useful and simple test to allow direct comparison of soil physical behaviour and expected soil density.",

        "Comment": "This study compared phosphorus (P) speciation and the relationship between bicarbonate extractable (Olsen) P and 0(.)01 m CaCl2 extractable P (a measure of potentially mobile P) in soils from plots of the Park Grass experiment started in 1856 at IACR-Rothamsted, UK and with and without nitrogen as (NH4)(2)SO4 and with and without calcium carbonate (CaCO3, lime). A point, termed the change point, was noted in Olsen P, above which 0.01 m CaCl2-P increased at a greater rate per unit increase in Olsen P than below this point. Previous findings have shown a change point for soils with a pH > 5.8 at 56 mg Olsen P/kg and at 120 mg Olsen P/kg for soils below this pH. Soils given (NH4)(2)SO4 annually since 1856 and with lime periodically since 1903 mostly had a pH between 3.7 to 5.7, some of these (NH4)(2)SO4 treated soils were limed to pH 6.5 and above from 1965. Irrespective of their pH in 1991/92 all the soils had a similar change point (120 mg Olsen P/kg) to that found for other soils with pH < 5.8 (112 mg Olsen P/kg). In a laboratory study lasting 30 days, the addition of CaCO3 to acid soils from the field experiment that had received (NH4)(2)SO4 had a similar change point to soils with pH < 5.8 irrespective of pH, suggesting soil P chemistry was controlled by the long period of soil acidity and this was not reversed by a short period at a higher pH. The effect of pH was attributed to the creation of P sorptive surfaces on aluminium precipitates compared with less acidic soils (pH > 5.8) where there was less exchangeable Al to be precipitated. This was confirmed with solid-state P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance, which indicated that for soils of similar total P concentration and pH, there was twice as much amorphous Al-P in soils given (NH4)(2)SO4 compared with those without. Changes in pH as a result of applications of (NH4)(2)SO4 or lime can greatly change the concentration of potentially mobile P due to the effects on Al solubility. Although there was less potentially mobile P in soils with pH < 5.8 than in soils above this pH, it is usually advised in temperate regions to maintain soils about pH 6.5 for arable crops.",

        "Comment": "Concern has been expressed that repeated use of pesticides may be leading to accumulation of residues in soil and to damaging effects on the environment. A long-term experiment, known as the Chemical Reference Plots, was started in 1974 on a silty clay loam soil at Rothamsted in which plots received applications of up to five pesticides (aldicarb, benomyl, chlorfenvinphos, glyphosate and chlorotoluron or triadimefon), each plot receiving the same treatment annually for up to 20 years. Spring barley was grown each year, and its yield was taken as an indicator of soil fertility. The glyphosate and triadimefon were applied to the autumn stubble prior to ploughing from growing seasons 1980 and 1982 respectively, chlorotoluron was sprayed pre-emergence (1974 and 1976 only) and the other compounds were incorporated into the soil in spring immediately before sowing (1974-1993 inclusive). No deleterious effects on crop productivity were observed from these pesticide applications, and no differences could be found in microbial processes in soils sampled in April 1992 save for a small increase in the amount of microbial-biomass carbon in plots receiving aldicarb. No pesticide residues could be detected in soil taken in August 1994, 17 months after the last experimental treatment. In laboratory incubations using these same soil samples, the degradation of aldicarb residues was greatly enhanced in plots that had received aldicarb for 20 years, whereas degradation rates of benomyl, chlorfenvinphos and triadimefon residues were not influenced by the treatment history.",

        "Comment": "The development of resilient cropping systems with high yield stability is becoming increasingly important due to future climatic and agronomic challenges. Consequently, it is essential to compare the effects of different agronomic management practices, such as cropping sequences and nutrient supply, on the stability of crop yields. Long-term experiments are a valuable resource for investigating these effects, as they provide enough time to accurately estimate stability parameters. The objective of the current study was to compare the effects of different cropping sequencing (#1: continuous v. rotational), fertilization (#2: mineral v. organic) and straw management techniques (in the case of continuous wheat; #3: removal v. incorporation) on the yield stability of winter wheat; yield risk (the probability of yield falling below a threshold yield level) and inter-annual yield variability were used as stability indicators of the effects. Long-term yield data from the Broadbalk Wheat Experiment (Rothamsted, UK) were analysed using a mixed model. Overall, the results showed that rotational cropping combined with sufficient mineral N fertilizer, with or without organic manure, ensured stable wheat yields while reducing yield risk. In contrast, higher yield risks and inter-annual yield variabilities were found in continuous wheat sections with less mineral N fertilizer or with organic manure only.",

        "Comment": "The Broadbalk Wheat Experiment at Rothamsted (UK) includes plots given the same annual applications of inorganic nitrogen (N) fertilizer each year since 1852 (48, 96 and 144 kg N ha, termed N-1, N-2 and N-3 respectively). These very long-term N treatments have increased total soil N content, relative to the plot never receiving fertilizer N (N-0), due to the greater return of organic N to the soil in roots, root exudates, stubble, etc (the straw is not incorporated). The application of 144 kg N ha for 135 years has increased total soil N content by 21%, or 570 kg ha (0-23 cm). Other plots given smaller applications of N for the same time show smaller increases; these differences were established within 30 years. Increases in total soil N content have been detected after 20 years in the plot given 192 kg N ha since 1968 (N-4). There was a proportionally greater increase in N mineralization. Crop uptake of mineralized N was typically 12-30 kg N ha greater from the N-3 and N-4 treatments than the uptake of c. 30 kg N ha from the N-0 treatment. Results from laboratory incubations show the importance of recently added residues (roots, stubble, etc) on N mineralization. In short-term (2-3 week) incubations, with soil sampled at harvest, N mineralization was up to 60% greater from the N-3 treatment than from N-0. In long-term incubations, or in soil without recently added residues, differences between long-term fertilizer treatments were much less marked. Inputs of organic N to the soil from weeds (principally Equisetum arvense L.) to the N-0-N-2 plots over the last few years may have partially obscured any underlying differences in mineralization. The long-term fertilizer treatments appeared to have had no effect on soil microbial biomass N or carbon (C) content, but have increased the specific mineralization rate of the biomass (defined as N mineralized per unit of biomass). Greater N mineralization will also increase losses of N from the system, via leaching and gaseous emissions. In December 1988 the N-3 and N-4 plots contained respectively 14 and 23 kg ha more inorganic N in the profile (0-100 cm) than the N-0 plot, due to greater N mineralization. These small differences are important as it only requires 23 kg N ha to be leached from Broadbalk to increase the nitrate concentration of percolating water above the 1980 EC Drinking Water Quality Directive limit of 11.3 mg N I. The use of fertilizer N has increased N mineralization due to the build-up of soil organic N. In addition, much of the organic N in Broadbalk topsoil is now derived from fertilizer N. A computer model of N mineralization on Broadbalk estimated that after applying 144 kg N ha for 140 years, up to half of the N mineralized each year was originally derived from fertilizer N. In the short-term, the amount of fertilizer N applied usually has little direct effect on losses of N over winter. In most years little fertilizer-derived N remains in Broadbalk soil in inorganic form at harvest from applications of up to 192 kg N ha. However, in two very dry years (1989 and 1990) large inorganic N residues remained at harvest where 144 and 192 kg N ha had been applied, even though the crop continued to respond to fertilizer N, up to at least 240 kg N ha.",

        "Comment": "Soil structure is an indicator of soil quality and its alterations following cropping system conversion or fertilization change evolve slowly. How such alterations vary with scale remains elusive. We investigated this based on the Rothamsted long-term wheat experiment (since 1843) in the UK. Triplicate cores 7 cm high and 10 cm in diameter were taken from plots that have been under different fertilizations or returned to natural woodland for more than one century for imaging using X-ray computed tomography with the voxel size being 40 mu m. We then broke each core and sampled three aggregates from it to scan with the voxel size being 1.5 mu m. For each core and aggregate sample, we calculated its pore size distribution, permeability and tortuosity. The results showed that the fertilization change >170 years ago reshaped the soil structure differently between the core scale and the aggregate scale. Macro-porosity of the pores (>40 mu m) in the cores unfertilized or fertilized with inorganic fertilizers was low and the pores were poorly connected in the top 10 cm of soil, compared to those given farmyard manure or in the woodland. In all treatments, the pores in the core images were hydraulically anisotropic with their permeability in the horizontal direction being higher than that in the vertical direction, whereas the aggregates were comparatively isotropic. The fertilization affected image porosity and permeability at core scale more significantly than at aggregate scale, and the aggregates fertilized with farmyard manure and in the woodland were more permeable than the aggregates in other treatments. It was also found that compared to no-fertilization or fertilization with complete fertilizers, fertilizing without phosphorus over the past 20 years increased the porosity and permeability of the aggregates but not of the cores. Fertilization with inorganic fertilizers increased the tortuosity of the macropores in the cores but not of the intra-aggregate pores, compared to no-fertilization. Porosity-permeability relationship for aggregates unfertilized or fertilized with inorganic fertilisers followed a power law with R-2 > 0.8. In contrast, the permeability of the aggregates in farmyard manure and in the woodland trended differently as their porosity increased. The results also revealed that the transport ability of the aggregates and cores responded differently to carbon in that with soil carbon increasing, the permeability of the aggregates increased asymptotically while the permeability of the cores, especially its horizontal component, increased exponentially.",

        "Comment": "Over a 10-year period, runoff and soil erosion on the plots of the Woburn Erosion Reference Experiment were concentrated in periods with sparse vegetation cover: in winter after the late planting of cereals; in spring after the planting of beets; or when soils were bare after harvest. The mean event runoff of 1.32 mm from plots cultivated up-and-downslope was significantly greater (P<0.05) than that from plots cultivated across-slope (0.82 mm). However, mean event soil loss was not significantly different between the two cultivation directions. No significant differences were found between minimal and standard cultivations. Mean event runoff from the across-slope/minimal tillage treatment combination (0.58 mm) was significantly less (P<0.01) than from the up-and-downslope/minimal tillage (1.41 mm), up-and-downslope/standard tillage (1.24 mm), and across-slope/standard tillage (1.07 mm) treatment combinations. Runoff from the across-slope/standard treatment combination was significantly (P<0.05) less than from the up-and-downslope/minimal tillage treatment. The across-slope/minimal tillage treatment combination had a significantly smaller (P<0.05) event soil loss (67 kg ha(-1)) than the up-and-downslope/standard tillage (278 kg ha(-1)) and up-and-downslope/minimal tillage (245 kg ha(-1)) combinations. Crop yields were significantly (P<0.05) higher on across-slope plots in 1988, 1996 and 1997 than on up-and-downslope plots, and were also higher (but not significantly) on the across-slope plots in 7 of the 8 remaining years. Minimal cultivation decreased yield compared with standard cultivation in one year only. We recommend that across-slope cultivation combined with minimal tillage be investigated at field scale to assess its suitability for incorporation into UK farming systems.",

        "Comment": "The electronic Rothamsted Archive, e-RA (www.era.rothamsted.ac.uk) provides a permanent managed database to both securely store and disseminate data from Rothamsted Research\u2019s long-term field experiments (since 1843) and meteorological stations (since 1853). Both historical and contemporary data are made available via this online database which provides the scientific community with access to a unique continuous record of agricultural experiments and weather measured since the mid-19th century. Qualitative information, such as treatment and management practices, plans and soil information, accompanies the data and are made available on the e-RA website. e-RA was released externally to the wider scientific community in 2013 and this paper describes its development, content, curation and the access process for data users. Case studies illustrate the diverse applications of the data, including its original intended purposes and recent unforeseen applications. Usage monitoring demonstrates the data are of increasing interest. Future developments, including adopting FAIR data principles, are proposed as the resource is increasingly recognised as a unique archive of data relevant to sustainable agriculture, agroecology and the environment. https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201872#supplementary-information",

        "Comment": "During the twentieth century statistical methods have transformed research in the experimental and social sciences. Qualitative evidence has largely been replaced by quantitative results and the tools of statistical inference have helped foster a new ideal of objectivity in scientific knowledge. The paper will investigate this transformation by considering the genesis of analysis of variance and experimental design, statistical methods nowadays taught in every elementary course of statistics for the experimental and social sciences. These methods were developed by the mathematician and geneticist R. A. Fisher during the 1920s, while he was working at Rothamsted Experimental Station, where agricultural research was in turn reshaped by Fisher\u2019s methods. Analysis of variance and experimental design required new practices and instruments in field and laboratory research, and imposed a redistribution of expertise among statisticians, experimental scientists and the farm staff. On the other hand the use of statistical methods in agricultural science called for a systematization of information management and made computing an activity integral to the experimental research done at Rothamsted, permanently integrating the statisticians\u2019 tools and expertise into the station research programme. Fisher\u2019s statistical methods did not remain confined within agricultural research and by the end of the 1950s they had come to stay in psychology, sociology, education, chemistry, medicine, engineering, economics, quality control, just to mention a few of the disciplines which adopted them.",

        "Comment": "A large fraction of soil organic matter (OM) resists decomposition over decades to centuries as indicated by long radiocarbon residence times, but the mechanisms responsible for the long-term (multi-decadal) persistence are debated. The current lack of mechanistic understanding limits our ability to accurately predict soil OM stock evolution under climate and land-use changes. Using a unique set of historic soil samples from five long-term (27-79 years) bare fallow experiments, we demonstrate that despite wide pedo-climatic diversity, persistent OM shows specific energetic signatures, but no uniform chemical composition. From an energetic point of view, thermal analyses revealed that combustion of persistent OM occurred at higher temperature and provided less energy than combustion of more labile OM. In terms of chemical composition, persistent OM was H-depleted compared to OM present at the start of bare fallow, but spectroscopic analyses of OM functional groups did not reflect a consistent chemical composition of OM across sites, nor substantial modifications with bare fallow duration. The low energy content of persistent OM may be attributed to a combination of reduced content of energetic C-H bonds or stronger interactions between OM and the mineral matrix. Soil microorganisms thus appear to preferentially mineralize high-energy OM, leaving behind material with low energy content. This study provides the first direct link between long-term persistence of OM in soil and the energetic barriers experienced by the decomposer community.",

        "Comment": "How we manage farming and food systems to meet rising demand is pivotal to the future of biodiversity. Extensive field data suggest that impacts on wild populations would be greatly reduced through boosting yields on existing farmland so as to spare remaining natural habitats. High-yield farming raises other concerns because expressed per unit area it can generate high levels of externalities such as greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient losses. However, such metrics underestimate the overall impacts of lower-yield systems. Here we develop a framework that instead compares externality and land costs per unit production. We apply this framework to diverse data sets that describe the externalities of four major farm sectors and reveal that, rather than involving trade-offs, the externality and land costs of alternative production systems can covary positively: per unit production, land-efficient systems often produce lower externalities. For greenhouse gas emissions, these associations become more strongly positive once forgone sequestration is included. Our conclusions are limited: remarkably few studies report externalities alongside yields; many important externalities and farming systems are inadequately measured; and realizing the environmental benefits of high-yield systems typically requires additional measures to limit farmland expansion. Nevertheless, our results suggest that trade-offs among key cost metrics are not as ubiquitous as sometimes perceived.",

        "Comment": "Long-term change and shorter-term variability in the atmospheric deposition of pollutants and marine salts can have major effects on the biogeochemistry and ecology of soils and surface water ecosystems. In the 1980s, at the time of peak acid deposition in the UK, deposition loads were highly dependent on prevailing weather types, and it was postulated that future pollution recovery trajectories would be partly dependent on any climate change-driven shifts in weather systems. Following three decades of substantial acidic emission reductions, we used monitoring data collected between 1992 and 2015 from four UK Environmental Change Network (ECN) sites in contrasting parts of Great Britain to examine the trends in precipitation chemistry in relation to prevailing weather conditions. Weather systems were classified on the basis of Lamb weather type (LWT) groupings, while emissions inventories and clustering of air mass trajectories were used to interpret the observed patterns. Concentrations of ions showed clear differences between cyclonic-westerly-dominated periods and others, reflecting higher marine and lower anthropogenic contributions in Atlantic air masses. Westerlies were associated with higher rainfall, higher sea salt concentrations, and lower pollutant concentrations at all sites, while air mass paths exerted additional controls. Westerlies therefore have continued to favour higher sea salt fluxes, whereas emission reductions are increasingly leading to positive correlations between westerlies and pollutant fluxes. Our results also suggest a shift from the influence of anthropogenic emissions to natural emissions (e.g., sea salt) and climate forcing as they are transported under relatively cleaner conditions to the UK. Westerlies have been relatively frequent over the ECN monitoring period, but longer-term cyclicity in these weather types suggests that current contributions to precipitation may not be sustained over coming years.",

        "Comment": "The decreasing mineral concentrations in the grains of cereals have recently stimulated research to better understand the cropping determinants of grain mineral composition. This study aimed to analyze the effects of liming on the mineral concentrations in the grains of three cereal crops: barley, oat, wheat. The hypothesis tested was that soil pH is the main driver of the grain nutrient concentrations in crops, through its influence on the soil extractable minerals. Macro nutrients (Ca, K, Mg, P, S), micro-nutrients (Cu, Fe, Mn, Se, Zn) and some trace elements (As, Cd, Pb) were analyzed. Two long term liming trials in SE England (1962 -) were studied, with the same crops sown in the same years. On each site, four liming rates were applied to 32 plots to create a pH range from approximately 4.5 to 7.5. The trials were subdivided into two P fertiliser treatments, consisting of a nil and regular P inputs. For a given crop, the effects of pH, soil type, concentrations of nutrients in soil extracts and of P treatment on the grain mineral concentrations were tested. This pairwise analysis was followed by a multiple linear regression analysis in order to determine the main explanatory variable for crop mineral concentration. Liming had a significant impact on most of the soil extractable mineral concentrations, except extractable K and Mg. The grain mineral concentrations exhibited significant differences between crops, the concentrations in wheat being the smallest. pH proved to have a larger direct effect on mineral concentrations in grain (e.g. Ca, Mg, P, Mn) than through its influence on extractable nutrients (e.g. Cd). Grain nutrients responses to pH were, however, not the same in the three crops. Differences in Cu and Zn were mostly accounted for by the effect of soil type, the soil with the higher CEC leading to the higher grain concentrations. For Fe, Pb and K, no correlation could be found between the grain mineral concentrations and the explanatory variables. Difficulties in explaining the grain mineral concentrations are due to specific crop responses to nutrients, usefulness of soil extractions, and complex physiological processes in mineral translocation from roots to grains. The results underline the difficulty of using ordinary soil analysis for predicting the quality of cereal grains for nutrition, and caution in the use of grain testing to recommend soil fertility enhancing practices.",

        "Comment": "The Auchenorrhyncha faunas of 2 contrasting types of grasslands seeded on chalk at Royston, Herts, UK, were compared with those from a range of semi-natural and agricultural grasslands. Among intensively studied sites, the Royston fauna was most similar to that of Castor Hanglands, an oolitic limestone grassland, and less closely related to those of 3 established chalk grassland sites. The similarity of the Royston and Castor Hanglands faunas lay mainly in the predominance of Arthaldeus pascuellus [Sorhoanus pascuellus] at both sites. On the established chalk grassland sites, other species predominated. The species richness of the Royston fauna was not markedly lower than the richness of established sites, but resident species were fewer. All sites had similar numbers of multi- and bivoltine breeding species, but significantly fewer univoltine species bred at Royston. Comparisons of annual totals of Auchenorrhyncha recorded showed grouping strictly by site. The Royston fauna was significantly richer than that of ryegrass leys on neutral soil, but not richer than the fauna of the classic Park Grass Plots established at Rothamsted in 1856, though more individuals were recorded at Royston. The Royston fauna was similar to the faunas of flood meadow grassland and 8-year-old seeded grassland on calcareous boulder clay in Cambridgeshire, particularly in the predominance of S. pascuellus. An extensive survey of calcareous grassland sites revealed few sites with faunas similar to that of Royston, mainly because S. pascuellus was not abundant on these sites. Later surveys at sites in Yorkshire and the East Midlands were similar to Royston, with S. pascuellus abundant on many of them. The results are discussed in relation to the establishment of grasslands for wildlife conservation. Interactions with plant species composition, soil type, availability of nitrogen, and management are considered.",

        "Comment": "This is a review of the activities of what rapidly became the leading plant nematology department in the world, based in what was at that time not only the most  important but also the most distinguished agricultural research station in the world. We first briefly review the research done in the period under each head of department before recording in more detail some of the long-term research programmes, including work on potato cyst nematode hatching factors, chemical control and biological control. These strong research activities flourished until the radical funding constraints that were introduced nationally following release of the Rothschild Report in 1973 forced the adoption of various management actions at research stations. The changed pattern of research funding systems, which evolved gradually from 1973 onwards, resulted in a different style of research collaboration and changes in research focus by institutes and their staff. It became fashionable for institutes to have mission statements and these were changed frequently by directors due to the need to respond to funding possibilities. Successive severe and progressive reductions in staffing and, inevitably, outputs culminated in the complete cessation of nematology research at Rothamsted in 2013, even though cutting edge work on biological control and molecular interactions between nematodes and their plant hosts was still being carried out.",

        "Comment": "The relationships between meteorological variables (average monthly maximum and minimum air temperature, total monthly precipitation) and crop yields of a long-term field experiment in southern England were examined to determine whether long-periodic changes in crop yields are associated with climatic variations. The study used the grain and straw yields from 1854 to 1967 of the Broadbalk winter wheat experiment at Rothamsted, UK. The main techniques used to describe the crop/weather relationships were correlation analysis and multiple regression. The results show that the long-term changes in crop yields at Rothamsted were partially related to climate variations at this site. The main influence on grain yields was precipitation. In all months there were negative correlations between grain yield and rainfall. A weak positive correlation was found between precipitation and straw yield from April to June (stem elongation) whereas in the other months the correlation coefficients remained negative. The maximum air temperature was positively correlated with straw yield in all months except May, June and July. Generally it was easier to explain the variability of straw yields by weather variations than that of grain yields. On the basis of simple multiple regression models it was possible to explain 33% of the grain and 50% of the straw yield variability by precipitation and temperature variations. Long-periodic changes in rainfall and temperature were reflected in observed and estimated crop yields.",

        "Comment": "The oxidative ratio (the ratio of moles of O2 produced per mole CO2 sequestered \u2013 OR) of the organic matter in the terrestrial biosphere governs the ability of the terrestrial biosphere to uptake CO2. The value of OR is known to vary between environments, but it would also be expected to vary with management. This study measured the OR of plant and soil samples from the long-term grassland plots on the Park Grass experiment at Rothamsted (SE England). The selected plots included those with different fertilizer inputs, including farmyard manure or inorganic fertilizers and an unfertilized control, each with and without lime. The measurements show that: (i) Use of inorganic fertilizer caused the OR of soil organic matter to increase. (ii) Farmyard manure (FYM) caused OR of the soil to increase but that of the vegetation decreased. (iii) Liming had the effect of decreasing OR and counteracting effects of fertilizer. (iv) The OR of the ecosystem increased with FYM application but decreased with inorganic fertilizer application. The global pattern in the use of organic amendments and inorganic fertilizers suggests that the likely impact of the predicted increase in global inorganic fertilizer use will result in a net decrease in the OR of the organic matter of the terrestrial biosphere, and an increase in its ability to act as a carbon sink. Corresponding increases in global FYM use and its impact upon global OR are unlikely to be large enough to counteract this effect. ",

In this paper, the contribution of ploughing permanent grassland and leys, including grassland renovation, to CO2 and N2O emissions and mitigation options are explored. Land use changes in the Netherlands during 1970-2020 are used as a case study. Three grassland management operations are defined: (i) conversion of permanent grassland to arable land and leys; (ii) rotations of leys with arable crops or bulbs; and (iii) grassland renovation. The Introductory Carbon Balance Model (ICBM) is modified to calculate C and N accumulation and release. Model calibration is based on ICBM parameters, soil organic N data and C to N ratios. IPCC emission factors are used to estimate N2O-emissions. The model is validated with data from the Rothamsted Park Grass experiments. Conversion of permanent grassland to arable land, a ley arable rotation of 3 years ley and 3 years arable crops, and a ley bulb rotation of 6 years ley and one year bulbs, result in calculated N2O and CO2 emissions totalling 250, 150 and 30 ton CO2-equivalents ha(-1), respectively. Most of this comes from CO2. Emissions are very high directly after ploughing and decrease slowly over a period of more than 50 years. N2O emissions in 3/3 ley arable rotation and 6/1 ley bulb rotation are 2.1 and 11.0 ton CO2-equivalents ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. From each grassland renovation, N2O emissions amount to 1.8 to 5.5 ton CO2-equivalents ha(-1). The calculated total annual emissions caused by ploughing in the Netherlands range from 0.5 to 0.65 Mton CO2-equivalents year(-1). Grassland renovation in spring offers realistic opportunities to lower the N2O emissions. Developing appropriate combinations of ley, arable crops and bulbs, will reduce the need for conversion of permanent pasture. It will also decrease the rotational losses, due to a decreased proportion of leys in rotations. Also spatial policies are effective in reducing emissions of CO2 and N2O. Grassland ploughing contributes significantly to N2O and CO2 emissions. The conclusion can be drawn that total N2O emissions are underestimated, because emissions from grassland ploughing are not taken into account. Specific emission factors and the development of mitigation options are required to account for the emissions and to realise a reduction of emissions due to the changes in grassland ploughing.",

        "Comment": "Recent archaeological studies of human diet have used stable nitrogen isotope ratios (delta N-15) from human bone collagen to infer the relative importance of terrestrial plant and animal foods. This approach is based on widely observed enrichment of delta N-15 up the food chain, plants having distinctly lower values than the herbivores that consume them. Studies of early farming diets in Britain, Denmark and Germany have tended to detect relatively high delta N-15 values (e.g. c. +9 parts per thousand), interpreted as evidence of a diet largely based on animal products, though arch acobotanical evidence for crop cultivation (e.g. carbonised cereal grain and chaff) is widespread. This paper investigates the impact of manuring on delta N-15 values in modern cereals, and of charring on these cereal values. The results from two long-term experiments demonstrate that manuring significantly raises delta N-15 in cereal grain and chaff. Depending on manuring levels and frequency, it appears that human diets with a major component of such grain would conventionally be interpreted as indicating a largely animal-based diet or a mixed plant/animal diet. Moreover, preliminary analyses of experimentally charred grain and chaff from manured and unmanured conditions are promising for the extraction of reliable ancient delta N-15 values from archaeobotanical cereal remains. The wider implications of these results, and the need for further work, are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "Comment": "Endophytes play an important role in plant growth promotion, bio-fertilization and pathogen control. We investigated the effects of tissue type, growth stage and soil fertilizers on the bacterial endophyte community of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum cv Hereward). Culturable endophytes were isolated from roots and leaves across six fertilizer treatments, at two developmental stages, GS 37 and 83. In total 804 strains were grouped into 29 operational taxonomic units using RFLP. Endophyte abundance was higher in roots than leaves and tissue type affected relative phylum abundance (p < 0.05). Proteobacteria dominated in the roots whereas Firmicutes and Actinobacteria dominated in the leaves. Growth stage was found to affect the endophyte community structure at the genus level. Higher abundance of endophytes was found in the treatment without fertilizer, a trend not found for soil bacterial abundances. Fertilizer treatment had no effect on phylum distribution in the roots but there were distinctions at the genus level. In the roots at GS 37 Plantibacter and Curtobacterium were linked with treatment 144 kg N ha\u20131 yr\u20131, whereas Arthrobacter and Agromyces showed strong associations with treatment 288 kg N ha\u20131 yr\u20131. These distinctions between treatments for the endophytic community did not reflect those observed in the underlying soil bacterial community, indicating that plant growth stage is a main driver of endophytic bacterial community structure in wheat.",

In the absence of long-term experiments where temperature and CO2 concentration were manipulated separately, we applied the crop simulation model Sirius with long-term daily meteorological data (1892\u20132016) for Rothamsted, Hertfordshire, UK (2007\u20132016 mean growing season temperature 1.03\u00b0C warmer than 1892\u20131991), and CO2 concentration over this period, to investigate the separate effects of historic CO2 and weather on simulated grain yield in three wheat cultivars of the modern era. We show a slight decline in simulated yield over the period 1892\u20132016 from the effect of weather (daily temperature, rainfall and sunshine hours) at fixed CO2 (294.50 ppm, 1892 reference value), but a maximum 9.4% increase when accounting for increasing atmospheric CO2 (from 294.50 to 404.21 ppm), differing slightly among cultivars. Notwithstanding considerable inter-annual variation, the slight yield decline at 294.50 ppm CO2 over this 125-year period from the historic weather simulations for Rothamsted agrees with the expected decline from temperature increase alone, but the positive yield trend with actual CO2 values does not match the recent stagnation in UK wheat yield.",

Once identified, carefully considered changes can be made to the treatment or management, and if they are successful yields will change. If suitable changes cannot be made to an experiment to ensure its continued relevance to sustainable crop production, then it should be stopped. Long-term experiments have many other uses. They provide a field resource and samples for research on plant and soil processes and properties, especially those properties where change occurs slowly and affects soil fertility. Archived samples of all inputs and outputs are an invaluable source of material for future research, and data from current and archived samples can be used to develop models to describe soil and plant processes. Such changes and uses in the Rothamsted experiments are described, and demonstrate that with the appropriate crop, soil and management, acceptable yields can be maintained for many years, with either organic manure or inorganic fertilizers.

Rothamsted conducts more than 20 long-term (>20 years) experiments in south-eastern England; several were started in the middle of the last century. Some have continued with minor changes, others have been modified considerably to ensure their continuation and relevance. Examples are given of the effect on soils and crop yields of organic matter, the availability of P, and acidification. The use of archived material in addressing problems not even considered when the experiments began is also discussed. Long-term experiments are essential in determining the factors affecting soil fertility and sustainable production. In many cases, effects may only be observed or interactions become apparent over an extended time. Full use should be made of existing experiments and data; in particular, those on different soil types and under different climatic conditions should be compared so that the information is valuable to farmers, advisers, legislators, and other scientists in both the local and wider community.",

        "Comment": "This chapter reviews contributions made to agricultural and environmental science and practice from research on temperate grassland carried out from 1982 to present at Rothamsted Research's North Wyke Research Station, Devon, UK. It describes the evolution of the research program and demonstrates the importance of sustained, interdisciplinary, and collaborative research. North Wyke has maintained a clear research focus, alongside an ability to adapt to changing grassland and environmental research needs and funding sources, and despite having changed affiliations on several occasions. The substantial contribution to agricultural and environmental science arising from the research station has influenced and continues to influence farm practice, research, and policy nationally and internationally. Some key topics have included nutrient cycling, farm waste management, gaseous emissions, biodiversity, grazing management, animal production (meat and milk), and forage quality. Currently, North Wyke Research Station is leading the way on taking increasingly holistic approaches to researching more efficient, sustainable approaches to grazing-livestock agricultural production. This involves the use of world-leading, facilities such as the North Wyke Farm Platform, comprising three farmlets, designed to test the productivity and environmental sustainability of contrasting temperate grassland beef and sheep systems. Future perspectives highlight key challenges facing the agricultural industry including climate change mitigation and adaptation, and the growing world population. Opportunities exist to tackle these challenges through technological advances, but also through increased integration of agricultural, environmental, economic and social research. North Wyke Research Station provides an example of a research facility where such challenges can be addressed.",

In all six years, straw grown without fertilizer N contained less carbon-13 (i.e. delta(13)C was more negative) than straw grown with fertilizer, although the magnitude of this difference varied with year. In a dry year, when dry matter response to fertilizer N was relatively small, there was a large difference between the delta(13)C of straw grown with and without N. Conversely, in a wet year, when there was a marked response to N, there was little difference in the isotopic composition of N-fertilized and unfertilized straw. Over the six years, the difference between the delta(13)C value of straw grown with and without nitrogen ((DC)-C-13, in parts per thousand) was related to drought, measured as the calculated soil water deficit on 15 July (W-j, in mm), by the equation (DC)-C-13 = -0.299 + 0.01034 W-j (r = 0.87).",

        "Comment": "Different agricultural practices can result in a decline in soil organic carbon (SOC) and a consequent reduction in soil structural stability. Experiments were conducted on soils with a range of SOC values, to quantify the destabilizing effects of increased tillage intensity. Different tillage intensity was simulated with the use of a falling weight, where specific energy levels, similar to those experienced during tillage, were reproduced. The level of destabilization was assessed by the quantity of mechanically dispersed clay (using a turbidimetric technique) and the quantity of water-stable aggregates (WSA) > 0.25 mm remaining after being shaken in water. The quantity of clay dispersed increased with increasing water content, in the absence of any mechanical pretreatment, the rate of increase rising sharply with declining SOC. Following simulated tillage, and at water contents above the plastic Limit, clay dispersion increased in proportion to the energy of disruption, and also increased with decreasing SOC levels. Below the plastic limit all the soils were relatively insensitive to mechanical disruption. A simple empirical model was derived to link clay dispersion to SOC, water content and energy of disruption. The proportion of WSA declined sharply with decreasing SOC, and to a lesser extent following tillage. The quantity of WSA following simulated intensive tillage (300 J kg(-1)) of grassland (SOC, 2.8-3.2 g (100 g)(-1)) was greater than that present, prior to tillage from fallow, arable and arable/ley rotation treatments (SOC 1.1-2.5 g (100 g)(-1)). Aggregate tensile strength was found to be relatively insensitive to differences in SOC. However, variations of strength within treatments, an indicator of soil friability, increased in proportion with SOC. A turbidity index was derived in which the turbidity of natural and remoulded aggregates was compared. Variation of this index with increasing mechanical energy is used as an indicator of the sensitivity of soils to damage during tillage. A visual representation is constructed to Link the sensitivity of soils to damage during tillage with both SOC and water potential. These experiments illustrate that management practices, which lead to a long term reduction in SOC, are responsible for an increase: in aggregate strength and reduction in stability plus an increase in sensitivity of soils to structural decline following subsequent tillage.

        "Comment": "1. Agricultural policy in the Pennine Dales Environmentally Sensitive Area in northern England aims to enhance plant species diversity in agriculturally improved meadows and return them to a 'traditional' species composition. The interacting effects of management on vegetation and productivity were tested in a split-split-split plot experiment. Three grazing treatments (autumn grazing with cattle and sheep, spring grazing with sheep. both regimes) were applied between 1990 and 98. Two fertilizer treatments (25 kg ha(-1) N plus 12.5 kg ha(-1) P2O5 and K2O, no fertilizer): three hay cut date treatments (14 June, 21 July, 1 September) and two seed addition treatments (no seed, seed of many species) were used within the grazing treatments. 2. By 1998, all the main treatments had produced small but significant changes to plant species diversity. A particularly large increase in diversity occurred with the combination of autumn and spring grazing. 21 July hay cut date and seed addition treatments. This change was achieved by an episodic rather than a regular increase in species over time. 3. Rhinanthus minor spread to most plots after its introduction as a constituent of the seed treatment. By 1996 it was particularly abundant in all treatment combinations that included autumn grazing, no mineral fertilizer and a July haycut. Populations of > 40 plants m(-2) were associated with the lowest yields of hay. 4. 'Unimproved-traditional' plant communities, mainly Festuca ovina-Agrostis capillaris-Galium saxatile grassland, occupied more than 66% of the trial area. Anthoxanthum odoratuam-Gerantium sylvaticum grasslands were most abundant in 1996, being primarily associated with the combination of autumn and spring grazing, 21 July and September hay cut dates and seed addition treatments, over both fertilizer treatments. 5. Yields of herbage biomass initially declined over time in all treatment combinations. Lowest yields in most years were associated with the autumn and spring grazing, 14 June cutting date and no fertilizer treatments. 6. Management to increase the number of plant species in agriculturally improved mesotrophic grassland requires the joint implementation of appropriate cut date and grazing regimes, probably to provide regeneration niches, and the application of seed to provide species to fill these niches. The small amount of mineral fertilizer used in this experiment had a measurable effect, but was of lesser importance.",

Here we focus on models of agricultural production, water movement and nutrient flow in a landscape. We validate these models against data from two long-term experiments, (the first a continuous wheat experiment and the other a permanent grass-land experiment) and an experiment where water and nutrient flow are measured from isolated catchments. The model simulated wheat yield (RMSE 20.3\u201328.6%), grain N (RMSE 21.3\u201342.5%) and P (RMSE 20.2\u201329% excluding the nil N plots), and total soil organic carbon particularly well (RMSE 3.1 ? 13.8 %), the simulations of water flow were also reasonable (RMSE 180.36 and 226.02%). We illustrate the use of our model framework to explore trade-offs between production and nutrient losses.",

        "Comment": "Abstract Cumulative crop recovery of synthetic fertiliser nitrogen (N) over several cropping seasons (legacy effect) generally receives limited attention. The increment in crop N uptake after the first-season uptake from fertiliser can be expressed as a fraction (?RE) of the annual N application rate. This study aims to quantify ?RE using data from nine long-term experiments (LTEs). As such, ?RE is the difference between first season (RE1st) and long-term (RELT) recovery of synthetic fertiliser N. In this study, RE1st was assessed either by the 15N isotope method or by a zero-N subplot freshly superimposed on a long-term fertilised LTE treatment plot. RELT was calculated by comparing N uptake in the total aboveground crop biomass between a long-term fertilised and long-term control (zero-N) treatment. Using a mixed linear effect model, the effects of climate, crop type, experiment duration, average N rate, and soil clay content on ?RE were evaluated. Because the experimental setup required for the calculation of ?RE is relatively rare, only nine suitable LTEs were found. Across these nine LTEs in Europe and North America, the mean ?RE was 24.4% (\u00b112.0%, 95% CI) of annual N application, with higher values for winter wheat than for maize. This result shows that fertiliser-N retained in the soil and stubble may contribute substantially to crop N uptake in subsequent years. Our results suggest that an initial recovery of 43.8% (\u00b111%, 95% CI) of N application may increase to around 66.0% (\u00b115%, 95% CI) on average over time. Furthermore, we found that ?RE was not clearly related to long-term changes in topsoil total N stock. Our findings show that the\u2014often used\u2014first-year recovery of synthetic fertiliser N application does not express the full effect of fertiliser application on crop nutrition. The fertiliser contribution to soil N supply should be accounted for when exploring future scenarios on N cycling, including crop N requirements and N balance schemes. Highlights Nine long-term cereal experiments in Europe and USA were analysed for long-term crop N recovery of synthetic N fertiliser. On average, and with application rates between 34 and 269?kg?N/ha, crop N recovery increased from 43.8% in the first season to 66.0% in the long term. Delta recovery was larger for winter wheat than maize. Observed increases in crop N uptake were not explained by proportionate increases in topsoil total N stock.",

        "Comment": "The results from 14 field trials comparing the long-term ( 20 to 120 years) effects of fertilisers and manures ( farmyard manure, slurry, and green manure) on crop production and soil properties are reviewed. In total there were 24 paired comparisons of the effects of manure and fertiliser. Some of the trials also contained a control ( no nutrient inputs) treatment. The input of nutrients as either fertilisers or manures had very large effects (150-1000%) on soil productivity as measured by crop yields. Manured soils had higher contents of organic matter and numbers of microfauna than fertilised soils, and were more enriched in P, K, Ca and Mg in topsoils and nitrate N, Ca and Mg in subsoils. Manured soils also had lower bulk density and higher porosity, hydraulic conductivity and aggregate stability, relative to fertilised soils. However, there was no significant difference (P < 0.05) between fertilisers and manures in their long-term effects on crop production. In the context of this set of international trials, the recent evidence from the Rothamsted classical long-term trials appears to be exceptional, due to the larger inputs of manures and larger accumulation of soil OM in these trials. It is suggested therefore that manures may only have a benefit on soil productivity, over and above their nutrient content, when large inputs are applied over many years. The evidence from these trials also shows that, because the ratio of nutrients in manures is different from the ratio of nutrients removed by common crops, excessive accumulation of some nutrients, and particularly P and N, can arise from the long-term use of manures, relative to the use of fertilisers. Under these conditions greater runoff of P, and leaching of N may result, and for soils with low P retention and/or in situations where organic P is leached, greater P leaching losses may occur. The use of manures, relative to fertilisers, may also contribute to poor water quality by increasing its chemical oxygen demand. It is concluded therefore that it cannot generally be assumed that the long-term use of manures will enhance soil quality - defined in terms of productivity and potential to adversely affect water quality - in the long term, relative to applying the same amounts of nutrients as fertiliser.",

        "Comment": "Most of the land in the Middle Ages, because it was heavy, was chronically dirty and this was a major reason for the low crop yields. The Broadbalk Field at Rothamsted demonstrates that yields on loams and heavy soils can be maintained at a higher figure than in medieval times without fertilizers and the complete rest every third year that the three-field rotation allowed for. But with their puny and illfed animals and inefficient implements, the impossibility of cross ploughing, and the absence of effective drainage, the land must generally have been in such a state of weediness that it is not surprising that the peasants and even their lords had to be content with yields so low that they make history.-Author",

        "Comment": "The influence of soil pH on the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) composition of the microbial community was investigated along the Hoosfield acid strip, Rothamsted Research, UK - a uniform pH gradient between pH 8.3 and 4.5. The influence of soil pH on the total concentration of PLFAs was not significant, while biomass estimated using substrate induced respiration decreased by about 25%. However, the PLFA composition clearly changed along the soil pH gradient. About 40% of the variation in PLFA composition along the gradient was explained by a first principal component, and the sample scores were highly correlated to pH (R-2 = 0.97). Many PLFAs responded to pH similarly in the Hoosfield arable soil compared with previous assessments in forest soils, including, e.g. monounsaturated PLFAs 16:1 omega 5, 16:1 omega 7c and 18:1 omega 7, which increased in relative concentrations with pH, and i16:0 and cy19:0, both of which decreased with pH. Some PLFAs responded differently to pH between the soil types, e.g. br18:0. We conclude that soil pH has a profound influence on the microbial PLFA composition, which must be considered in all applications of this method to detect changes in the microbial community.

        "Comment": "The evolution and spread of pan-azole resistance alleles in clinical and environmental isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus is a global human health concern. The identification of hotspots for azole resistance development in the wider environment can inform optimal measures to counteract further spread by minimizing exposure to azole fungicides and reducing inoculum build-up and pathogen dispersal. We investigated the  fngicide sensitivity status of soil populations sampled from arable crops and the wider environment and compared these with urban airborne populations. Low levels of azole resistance were observed for isolates carrying the CYP51A variant F46Y/M172V/E427K, all belonging to a cluster of related cell surface protein (CSP) types which included t07, t08, t13, t15, t19, and t02B, a new allele. High levels of resistance were found in soil isolates carrying CYP51A variants TR34/L98H and TR46/Y121F/T289A, all belonging to CSP types t01, t02, t04B, or t11. TR46/Y121F/M172V/T289A/G448S (CSP t01) and TR46/Y121F/T289A/S363P/I364V/G448S (CSP t01), a new haplotype associated with high levels of resistance, were isolated from Dutch urban air samples, indicating azole resistance evolution is ongoing. Based on low numbers of pan-azole resistant isolates and lack of new genotypes in soils of fungicide-treated commercial and experimental wheat crops, we consider arable crop production as a coldspot for azole resistance development, in contrast to previously reported flower bulb waste heaps. This study also shows that, in addition to azole resistance, several lineages of A. fumigatus carrying TR-based CYP51A variants have also developed acquired resistance to methyl benzimidazole carbamate, quinone outside inhibitor and succinate dehydrogenase (Sdh) inhibitor fungicides through target-site alterations in the corresponding fungicide target proteins; beta-tubulin (F200Y), cytochrome b (G143A), and Sdh subunit B (H270Y and H270R), respectively. Molecular typing showed that several multi-fungicide resistant strains found in agricultural soils in this study were clonal as identical isolates have been found earlier in the environment and/or in patients. Further research on the spread of different fungicide-resistant alleles from the wider environment to patients and vice versa can inform optimal practices to tackle the further spread of antifungal resistance in A. fumigatus populations and to safeguard the efficacy of azoles for future treatment of invasive aspergillosis.

        "Comment": "A single pulse of 15N-labelled fertilizer was applied in spring as NH4 NO3 to each of four plots on the Broadbalk Continuous Wheat Experiment. Wheat has been grown on this experiment for more than 140 yr. The labelled N was applied at 48, 96, 144 and 192 kg N ha-1 yr-1 for the four plots. In subsequent years the plots reverted to unlabelled N, again given at these rates. Soils receiving inorganic fertilizer contained more biomass than soil from the plot that has never received inorganic N, but there was litter difference in the microbial biomass N content of soils that had had 48, 96, 144 or 192 kg N ha-1 for many years. There were no consistent changes during a 4-yr period in total microbial biomass N. Of the labelled fertilizer applied, 3-8% was present in the soil microbial biomass at the first harvest after application of labelled fertilizer. Of the total labelled N remaining in the soil at the first harvest, 19-27% was present in the microbial biomass. In the plot receiving 192 kg N ha-1 yr-1, labelled biomass N declined from 5.69 kg ha-1 at the first harvest, to 4.50 at the second, to 3.35 at the third and to 2.35 at the fourth. In a subsidiary experiment, more N was retained in the soil at harvest when the fertilizer was added in the ammonium form than as nitrate; 32.6 and 19.5 kg ha-1, respectively, for additions of 147 kg fertilizer N ha-1. However, of the labelled N retained in the soil, 34% was present in the microbial biomass, whether the labelled N had originally been added in the ammonium form or in the nitrate form.",

The model comprises an input compartment (containing the N in roots and other plant debris entering the soil plus the inorganic N immobilized during the decomposition of this debris), feeding the microbial biomass compartment and the humus compartment, which in turn feed the soil inorganic N compartment. The model was fitted to data from the plot receiving 192 kg N ha-1 yr-1 by iterative adjustment of the five independent parameters it contains. The value for the turnover time of N in the soil microbial biomass is 1.52 yr, the corresponding annual flux through the biomass being 125 kg N ha-1 yr-1. Of this flux, 59 kg comes from the input compartment and 66 kg from the humus compartment.",

Numbers of white reticulate spores were most affected by fertilizer. On Little Knott wheat plots, N treatment reduced VA infection and spore numbers. All spores were of the laminate type. On a light sandy soil at Woburn, where wheat was grown in rotation with potatoes and legumes, mainly spores of the reticulate type were found and their numbers were greatly reduced by N fertilizer. In Vicia faba, N had no clear effect on spore numbers. In a rotation of potatoes, barley and swedes, most VA infection was present in plots given least P and most spores occurred in plots given intermediate amounts of P. The results are compared with those of other field and glasshouse experiments.",

        "Comment": "The Park Grass Experiment, begun in 1856, is the oldest ecological experiment in existence. Its value to science has changed and grown since it was founded to answer agricultural questions. In recent times the experiment has shown inter alia how: plant species richness, biomass and pH are related; community composition responds to climatic perturbation and nutrient additions; soil is acidified and corrected by liming. It also provided one of the first demonstrations of the evolution of adaptation at a very local scale and contains a putative case of the evolution of reproductive isolation by reinforcement. The application of molecular genetic markers to archived plant material promises to reveal a whole new chapter of genetic detail about the long-term dynamics of plant populations. Over the range of values observed at Park Grass, biomass (productivity) has a negative effect upon species richness. Any positive effect of species richness on productivity could only be weak by comparison. The experiment provides support for both the competitive exclusion and pool size hypotheses for determination of species density. Instantaneous comparisons of species richness between plots do not accurately reflect temporal rates of loss which may be multiplicative rather than additive. This suggests that comparisons among sites, nutrient inputs, especially N treatments, or soil acidity may in general underestimate the threat posed to plant species diversity by long-term changes in plant nutrient availability, both enrichment and depletion. Differences between plots at the community level are maintained despite a flow of propagules between plots. There is no strong evidence for a spatial mass effect. Guild (grass/legume/other) compositions of plant communities have equilibrated, but the species composition within guilds is more dynamic and continues to change over time, suggesting that species and guild abundances are independently regulated. At least some members of all the major trophic levels, including predators (spiders), herbivores (leafhoppers) and detritivores (springtails) are treatment-specific in their distributions. Plant populations on Park Grass are subdivided by treatments which, to some degree, have led to plots becoming genetically isolated from one another and decoupled demographically. This subdivision has created a metapopulation structure in each species, characterized by species-specific rates of local colonization and extinction. Inverse clines in flowering time occur in the grass Anthoxanthum odoratum across some plot boundaries. These suggest that reproductive isolation between plots has been reinforced by natural selection. Drift as well as selection may have taken place in A. odoratum, especially on plots where effective population size is restricted by population bottlenecks caused by drought. Park Grass illustrates how long-term experiments grow in value with time and how they may be used to investigate scientific questions that were inconceivable at their inception. This is as likely to be true of the future of Park Grass as it has proved to be of its past.",

        "Comment": "Long-term ecological experiments provide unique opportunities to observe the effects of natural selection. The Park Grass Experiment at Rothamsted Experiment Station in Hertfordshire, UK, is the longest running ecological experiment that incorporates fertilization treatments and has been ongoing since 1856. In the 1970s, local adaptation was observed in the grass Anthoxanthum odoratum to the elevated soil aluminium levels of the fertilized plots. Gould etal. () have utilized this system to reevaluate the extent of local adaptation, first documented nearly 45years ago (Snaydon ), and to use emerging molecular approaches to identify candidate genes for the adaptation. From their work, they identify several plausible candidate loci for aluminium tolerance. This work shows the power of long-term field-based trials in a scientific age concentrated on rapidly emerging molecular techniques often utilized in short, narrowly focused laboratory or controlled environment experiments. The current study clearly illustrates the benefits gained by combining these molecular approaches within long-term monitoring experiments that can be regularly revisited in a changing world and used to address questions on evolutionary scales.",

        "Comment": "Soil exoenzymes released by microorganisms break down organic matter and are crucial in regulating C, N and P cycling. Soil pH is known to influence enzyme activity, and is also a strong driver of microbial community composition; but little is known about how alterations in soil pH affect enzymatic activity and how this is mediated by microbial communities. To assess long term enzymatic adaptation to soil pH, we conducted enzyme assays at buffered pH levels on two historically managed soils maintained at either pH 5 or 7 from the Rothamsted Park Grass Long-term experiment. The pH optima for a range of exoenzymes involved in C, N, P cycling, differed between the two soils, the direction of the shift being toward the source soil pH, indicating the production of pH adapted isoenzymes by the soil microbial community. Soil bacterial and fungal communities determined by amplicon sequencing were clearly distinct between pH 5 and soil pH 7 soils, possibly explaining differences in enzymatic responses. Furthermore, ?-glucosidase gene sequences extracted from metagenomes revealed an increased abundance of Acidobacterial producers in the pH 5 soils, and Actinobacteria in pH 7 soils. Our findings demonstrate that the pH optimum of soil exoenzymes adapt to long term changes in soil pH, the direction being dependent on the soil pH shift; and we provide further evidence that changes in functional microbial communities may underpin this phenomena, though new research is now needed to directly link change in enzyme activity optima with microbial communities. More generally, our new findings have large implications for modelling the efficiency of different microbial enzymatic processes under changing environmental conditions.",

        "Comment": "Soybean (Glycine max) offers an important source of plant-based protein. Currently much of Europe's soybean is imported, but there are strong economic and agronomic arguments for boosting local production. Soybean is grown in central and eastern Europe but is less favoured in the North due to climate. We conducted field trials across three seasons and two sites in the UK to test the viability of early-maturing soybean varieties and used the data from these trials to calibrate and validate the Rothamsted Landscape Model. Once validated, the model was used to predict the probability soybean would mature and the associated yield for 26 sites across the UK based on weather data under current, near-future (2041\u201360) and far-future (2081\u20132100) climate. Two representative concentration pathways, a midrange mitigation scenario (RCP4.5) and a high emission scenario (RCP8.5) were also explored. Our analysis revealed that under current climate early maturing varieties will mature in the south of the UK, but the probability of failure increases with latitude. Of the 26 sites considered, only at one did soybean mature for every realisation. Predicted expected yields ranged between 1.39\u00a0t\u00a0ha?1 and 1.95\u00a0t\u00a0ha?1 across sites. Under climate change these varieties are likely to mature as far north as southern Scotland. With greater levels of CO2, yield is predicted to increase by as much as 0.5\u00a0t\u00a0ha?1 at some sites in the far future, but this is tempered by other effects of climate change meaning that for most sites no meaningful increase in yield is expected. We conclude that soybean is likely to be a viable crop in the UK and for similar climates at similar latitudes in Northern Europe in the future but that for yields to be economically attractive for local markets, varieties must be chosen to align with the growing season.",

        "Comment": "Results from the UK were reviewed to quantify the impact on climate change mitigation of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks as a  result of (1) a change from conventional to less intensive tillage and (2) addition of organic materials including farm manures, digested biosolids, cereal straw, green manure and paper crumble. The average annual increase in SOC deriving from reduced tillage was 310 kg C \u00b1 180 kg C ha?1 yr?1. Even this accumulation of C is unlikely to be achieved in the UK and northwest Europe because farmers practice rotational tillage. N2O emissions may increase under reduced tillage, counteracting increases in SOC. Addition of biosolids increased SOC (in kg C ha?1 yr?1 t?1 dry solids added) by on average 60 \u00b1 20 (farm manures), 180\u00b1 24 (digested biosolids), 50 \u00b1 15 (cereal straw), 60 \u00b1 10 (green compost) and an estimated 60 (paper crumble). SOC accumulation declines in long-term experiments (>50 yr) with farm manure applications as a new equilibrium is approached. Biosolids are typically already applied to soil, so increases in SOC cannot be regarded as mitigation. Large increases in SOC were deduced for paper crumble (>6 t C ha?1 yr?1) but outweighed by N2O emissions deriving from additional fertiliser. Compost offers genuine potential for mitigation because application replaces disposal to landfill; it also decreases N2O emission.",

        "Comment": "This study examines the relationships between meteorological variables (average monthly maximum and minimum air temperature, total monthly precipitation) and crop yields of a long-term field experiment in southern England. The aim is to determine whether the long-periodic changes in crop yields are associated with climatic variations. This investigation uses the grain and straw yields (from 1854 to 1967) of the Broadbalk winter wheat experiment at Rothamsted, UK, which is one of the oldest agricultural field experiments in the world. In this study the main techniques used to describe the crop weather relationships are correlation analysis and multiple regression. The results show that the long-term changes in crop yields at Rothamsted are partially related to climate variations at this site. The main influence on grain yields is precipitation. In all months there are negative correlations between grain yield and rainfall. A weak positive correlation is found between precipitation and straw yield from April to June (stem elongation) whereas in the other months the correlation coefficients remain negative. The maximum air temperature is positively correlated with the straw yield in all months except May, June and July. Generally it is easier to explain the variability of straw yields by weather variations than it is that of grain yields. On the basis of simple multiple regression models it is possible to explain 33% of the grain and 50% of the straw yield variability by precipitation and temperature variations. Long periodic changes in rainfall and temperature are reflected in estimated crop yields. The lowest grain and straw yields are observed in wet cold as well as in wet warm years whereas the highest grain yields are more frequent in dry or cold years and the highest straw yields in dry or warm years.",

        "Comment": "The concentration of chlorophyll in a crop can be related to both the position of the red edge in a reflectance spectrum and the yield of that crop. The use of a remotely-sensed red edge to estimate yield is dependent upon a well-understood relationship between chlorophyll concentration and yield and a poorly understood relationship between red edge and chlorophyll concentration. To determine the form of the relationship between red edge and chlorophyll concentration a field experiment was undertaken using a wheat crop with an exceptionally large range of chlorophyll concentrations. The non-linear form of the relationship between red edge and chlorophyll concentration meant that estimates of red edge could be used to estimate chlorophyll concentration up to 0.5 mg g-1 and thereby yield up to 6t ha-1.",

        "Comment": "Drought stress and virus yellows disease are two of the major problems of sugarbeet crop production in the UK. We have calculated the annual national drought losses from 1980 to 1995 by using long term data sets for two sites (IACR-Broom's Barn, Suffolk and ADAS Gleadthorpe, Nottinghamshire) to relate yield loss to cumulative potential summer moisture deficit, and combining these relationships with regional meteorological records, soil type and crop distribution data. Experimentally measured relationships between yield losses and the timing of virus yellows infection were combined with annual survey data of the extent of the problem, and calculated infection dates from the UK aphid suction trap network, to calculate actual national annual losses to the disease. Potential losses in the absence of control measures were then calculated by use of data from trials and surveys of pesticide use. The results showed a mean annual loss of production to drought stress of 141000 t/year of sugar, 10.5% of production, with a loss to the industry of 27.9 million. Losses in individual years varied from zero to 25 times the mean figure. Actual losses to virus yellows were much smaller, due to the efficacy of treatments, averaging 24700 t/year of sugar (1.8% of national yield, financial loss 5.5 million). Average potential virus yellows losses in the absence of control measures were approximately double this.Control of virus yellows is a major, cost-effective contributor to rising and consistent sugarbeet production. Nationally, irrigation has made little impact on drought losses and, due to constraints in surface water supply, this situation appears likely to continue. Improved drought stress tolerance represents the largest single opportunity for yield and profitability improvement of the sugarbeet crop in the UK at present. Predicted climate change appears likely to increase the severity of both drought and disease stresses. Drought stress appears relatively less important in other NW European sugarbeet-growing areas.",

        "Comment": "Over the past 60 years, more than 100 experiments have been conducted using manufactured and organic fertilisers labelled with the stable isotope N-15. Organic N forms included crop residues, green manures, composts, animal manures and slurries in either crop sequences or successive cuttings of pasture grasses. As stated in the pioneering paper of Low and Piper (1957), the use of N-15-labelled materials is essential to follow the dynamics of fertiliser N in the soil-plant system. The majority of studies used N-15-labelled manufactured fertilisers. In general there was no difference of N fertiliser form on the N-15 recovery in the 1st residual crop (R-1) and in subsequent crops (R-2, R-3, R-n...). The N-15 recovery was <10% of added N in the R-1 crop and less in subsequent crops (R-2, R-3), with the exception of studies where severe water stress limited crop growth in the year of N application (Yr(0)). High mineral N remained in the root zone which was assimilated by the subsequent crops, giving a higher residual value in the R-1 crop than was normally observed. The similarity of the results from more than 100 studies, and a boot strapping analysis, suggested that dilution of the N-15 by the large unlabelled mineralisable soil organic N pool compromises the use of the techniques to explore residual uptake of immobilised N-15. The isotope technique does, however, enable researchers to monitor the rate of incorporation of the N into microbial biomass and more recalcitrant organic N forms within the soil organic matter.",

        "Comment": "Despite a high energy requirement, the mouldboard plough remains the dominant tillage tool in northwest Europe. The aim of this work was to evaluate the relative influences of soil texture (clay content), soil organic carbon (SOC) and long-term management on soil-specific draught (S), where S is the force per cross-sectional area of worked soil. Measurements were made during autumn 2000 on the then 157-year-old Broadbalk wheat experiment at Rothamsted, UK, where clay contents vary from 19 to 39% and the different cropping history, mineral and organic fertilizer treatments lead to SOC values of 0.7-3.2%. Minimum SOC values increased with increasing clay and were associated with zero or low mineral N inputs, while higher SOC values (> 2%) were associated with long-term applications of farmyard manure (FYM), despite these being on the lighter (< 24% clay) soils. S values ranged between 52 and 142 kPa, with higher values co-located in areas with high clay contents. Contour maps were generated to illustrate the spatial variability of S and show similarity to those for clay. Where FYM had been added, S was 66 kPa compared with 74 kPa where only mineral or no fertilizer was applied on soils of the same texture. Increasing applications of mineral N resulted in relatively small increases in SOC but up to 12% reduction in S.",

Establishing trade-offs and synergies between traits and services has largely relied on meta-analyses of studies from different systems and environments. This study demonstrated the value of focused studies of long-term experiments in grassland systems that measure traits and services in the same space and time to better understand the ecological constraints underlying these trade-offs and synergies. An analysis is presented that uses data from the Park Grass Experiment at Rothamsted Research on above-ground productivity, species richness and soil organic carbon stocks to quantify the relationships between these three outcomes and the power of variance in plant functional traits in explaining them. There was a trade-off between plots with high productivity, nitrogen inputs and soil organic carbon and plots with high species richness that was explained by a functional gradient of traits that are indicative of contrasting strategies of resource acquisition of resource conservation. Examples were identified of using functional traits to identify opportunities for mitigating these trade-offs and moving toward more multifunctional systems.",

        "Comment": "Most models for the turnover of soil organic matter (SOM) include a compartment that is either considered inert, or has a very slow turnover time. This is usually only a conceptual fraction, included in the models to allow realistic simulation of SOM turnover following changes in land use or management, or to balance the great age of soils as given by radiocarbon dates. Conceptual model pools range from very active pools which have rapid turnover times, to effectively inert pools, which do not turn over on the pedological timescale. In reality SOM is likely to be a mixture of materials of different ages and quality, which may not be readily represented by a number of discrete pools. Current SOM models are reviewed, and model approaches to, and the significance of refractory SOM (RSOM) discussed. Simulations of SOM turnover for the Rothamsted Broadbalk Winter Wheat Experiment using the Rothamsted Carbon Model (RothC) and CENTURY are presented as examples.",

        "Comment": "Sulfonates are a key component of the sulfur present in agricultural soils. Their mobilization as part of the soil sulfur cycle is mediated by rhizobacteria, and involves the oxidoreductase AsfA. In this study, the effect of fertilization regime on rhizosphere bacterial asfA distribution was examined at the Broadbalk long-term wheat experiment, Rothamsted, UK, which was established in 1843, and has included a sulfur-free treatment since 2001. Direct isolation of desulfonating rhizobacteria from the wheat rhizospheres led to the identification of several Variovorax and Polaromonas strains, all of which contained the asfA gene. Rhizosphere DNA was isolated from wheat rhizospheres in plots fertilized with inorganic fertilizer with and without sulfur, with farmyard manure or from unfertilized plots. Genetic profiling of 16S rRNA gene fragments [denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)] from the wheat rhizospheres revealed that the level of inorganic sulfate in the inorganic fertilizer was correlated with changes in the general bacterial community structure and the betaproteobacterial community structure in particular. Community analysis at the functional gene level (asfA) showed that 40% of clones in asfAB clone libraries were affiliated to the genus Variovorax. Analysis of asfAB-based terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) fingerprints showed considerable differences between sulfate-free treatments and those where sulfate was applied. The results suggest the occurrence of desulfonating bacterial communities that are specific to the fertilization regime chosen and that arylsulfonates play an important role in rhizobacterial sulfur nutrition.",

Some of these experiments continue today. The Broadbalk Wheat and Park Grass Continuous Hay experiments (established 1843 and 1856 respectively) are perhaps the most well-known, but several others, including Hoosfield Spring Barley are of increasing importance. Initial research focused on the value of fertilizers and manures for crop production, but, over time, the experiments have been modified to examine new scientific questions relevant to current agricultural issues. Here we present examples of their contribution to agro-ecological research, including studies on the effects of fertilizers and manures on soil organic matter and grassland species diversity together with more recent work, using modern  techniques, to examine the effects of management on changes in soil physical properties, crop micronutrient concentrations, soil microbial diversity, and fungicide resistance in plant pathogens.

        "Comment": "The Rothamsted long-term experiments - the Classicals - were started almost 150 yr ago. These experiments were originally designed to study the N, P, K, Na, Mg, and Si needs of the field crops then grown in England. This was done by comparing these inorganic nutrients, in various combinations, with farmyard manure, the traditional source of fertility at that time. Although the questions the experiments were originally designed to answer have long been resolved, the experiments continue to give results of interest to agronomists, ecologists, soil scientists, plant pathologists, and others. The experiments show that grain yields can be sustained (and even increased) for almost 150 years in monocultures of wheat and barley given organic or inorganic fertilizer annually. They provide data on the long-term effects of inorganic fertilizers and organic manures on soil or organic matter levels. These data have been used to test computer-based models for the turnover of organic matter in soil. Again, long-term N balances show that there are considerable inputs of N to the soil/plant system, amounting to some 30 kg N/ha annually in unfertilized wheat and up to 65 kg/ha annually in an arable soil reverting to woodland. These and other results are used to consider the advantages and disadvantages of long-term experiments. Wisely used, long-term experimental sites provide information on the long-term sustainability of agricultural systems that can be obtained in no other way.",

        "Comment": "Maintaining soil fertility and sustaining or increasing crop yield is of worldwide importance. Many factors impact upon the complex biological, chemical and physical processes which govern soil fertility. Changes in fertility caused by acidification, declining levels of organic matter, or P and K status may take many years to appear. These properties can in turn be affected by external influences such as atmospheric pollution, global change, or changes in land management practice. Long-term experiments provide the best practical means of studying changes in soil properties and processes and providing information for farmers, scientists and policy makers. This paper shows how the experiments run at Rothamsted in southeast England continue to provide data which are highly relevant to today's agriculture and wider environmental concerns. Examples are given of how crop yield is affected by soil organic matter, by pests and disease and by P nutrition. The effect of atmospheric pollution on soil acidity and the mobilization of heavy metals are also examined. The need for making better use of existing long-term experiments is stressed.",

        "Comment": "Three great heads of statistics at Rothamsted made important contributions to the design and analysis of experiments. Ronald Aylmer Fisher (1890-1962) was at Rothamsted Experimental Station from 1919 to 1933, initially as the sole statistician and then as the head of statistics. When he left to become Galton Professor of Eugenics at University College London he was succeeded as head of statistics by Frank Yates (1902-1994), who had only arrived to work at Rothamsted two years earlier. Yates was to remain the head of statistics for 35 years. When he retired in 1968, his successor was John Nelder (1924-2010), who had previously worked briefly at Rothamsted but who was, at the time of his appointment, head of statistics at The National Vegetable Research Station in Wellesbourne. John Nelder remained head until his retirement in 1984.",

        "Comment": "The rotation II experiment at Saxmundham, which ran from 1899-1952, was designed to show how limited quantities of FYM, N and P could best be allocated to the crops of a four-course rotation; there were also tests of additional quantities of N and P. Both FYM and P fertilizer gave large increases in the yield of all crops, but the profitability of the rotation as a whole proved to be little affected by which crops received FYM or P fertilizer. The rates of N tested were too small to provide any information relevant to current farm practices.",

        "Comment": "Data from the Woburn Erosion Reference Experiment (Bedfordshire, UK) were used to test the hypothesis that losses of phosphorus (P) in small erosion events are as great as those in infrequent large events, and to examine the effect of storm characteristics on the selective enrichment of P in eroded sediment. For almost every plot event in the period 1988 to 1994, the clay-sized fraction of the sediment was enriched compared with the soil of the plots. There was more variation in clay enrichment for smaller erosion events than for larger ones. The clay and P contents of the sediment were strongly correlated (p < 0.01), and there was a wider range of P concentrations in the sediment derived from small events than in that from large events. However, individual events resulting in small soil losses (< 100 kg) did not account for greater P losses than larger events (> 100 kg). The greater frequency of smaller events, combined with the likelihood of higher P concentrations in the sediment, therefore accounted for a greater proportion of the P lost over the 6-yr period than the infrequent large events. Phosphorus concentrations generally increased with increasing peak discharge and decreased with increasing event duration. For the same return period, P losses were generally greater from plots cultivated up and down the slope than from those cultivated across the slope. Overall, our results suggest that small erosion events should be controlled to prevent P contamination of surface waters and that the most effective means of doing this are by the introduction of minimal tillage techniques and across-slope cultivations.",

Both DCD and NaClO3 inhibited the net nitrification rate, while c-PTiO had no significant effects, and NaClO3 had a much greater inhibitory effect (> 60%) in all soils than DCD. No significant changes in total microbial abundance were observed with DCD and NaClO3. DCD limited only the growth of AOB; however, NaClO3 inhibited growth of both AOA and Nitrospira-NOB with no significant effects on AOB and Nitrobacter-NOB. Probably NaClO3 inhibited both ammonia oxidation and nitrite oxidation. This is the first report to reveal the inhibitory effects of NaClO3 on a specific nitrification process, helping to clarify the ecological niche of nitrifiers and the potential of nitrification inhibitors applied to soil.",

The turnover of C in various separates from long\u2013term field experiments with maize was measured using the natural 13C labelling technique. The Rothamsted carbon model gave a good prediction of the observed C turnover. Primary particle\u2013size fractions coarser than 50 ?m had short lives, and could be associated with the plant structural compartment of models. Water\u2013extractable components are enriched in young C but cannot be associated with labile compartments. None of the chemical separates obtained by acid hydrolysis, wet oxidation, thermic oxidation, pyrolysis or alkaline extraction, were enriched either in young or old C. The results showed neither a sequential relation between fulvic acids and humic acids nor a resistance of nonhydrolysable material. The range of lifetimes of soil C seems to be determined more by physical position and protection than by the chemical nature of SOM.",

The samples were separated into grasses and other species and the material in each group was then halved; one half was washed and the other was left unwashed. Analysis of Cd was by Zeeman correction GFAAS following a nitric acid digestion. The results showed that washing the samples prior to analysis made no difference to their Cd concentrations and that there was almost the same concentration of Cd in grasses and in other species. This implies that Cd remaining on leaf surfaces and changes in sward composition have not made a significant contribution to the previously reported underlying changes in herbage Cd over the last 130 years. Herbage Cd content has changed in response to either an underlying increase in soil Cd, increases in absorbed atmospherically derived Cd and or changes in soil chemistry.",

The major factor affecting the amount of soluble P and K is the frequency of gowing potatoes which are generously manured and leave large residues of P and K in soil. The present Ievels of soil carbon and nirogen are related to historic cropping rather than recent changes.",

        "Comment": "Some scientific work can be so far ahead of its time that it is not taken up by contemporaries and is largely forgotten. High-resolution digital soil sensing and mapping is a classic example of this. The earliest work in this area can be found in three papers in 1925 and another in 1928 by the Rothamsted soil physicists Haines and Keen. This was not really followed up until the 1990s when precision agriculture became the focus. The major developments in these papers are disinterred. Haines and Keen were concerned with how tillage forces varied, in order to design efficient and effective tillage operations. The first paper described instrumentation - a dynamometer - capable of sensing soil strength (actually drawbar pull) and its real-time recording, which they designed and built. The second looked at soil uniformity 'by means of dynamometer and plough'. They produced perhaps the first contour maps of a soil property at high (or any) resolution. The third paper dealt with the Rothamsted classical experiments which are now in their 167th year. The results of the Broadbalk experiment are shown as a perspective plot (familiar to all users of surface plotting programs) but constructed by quite different means. They found, perhaps to their surprise, that the signal of intrinsic soil differences in strength was heavily imprinted over the treatment effects even after 80 years of continuous wheat. In the fourth paper they recognised the need for a more light-weight, portable, and robust sensing system which they designed, built, and demonstrated, as well as a data-filtering technique based on the viscosity of oil in a sensor-recording system.",

This supports the hypothesis that P. hysterium significantly suppresses reproduction in T. pratensis. Furthermore, seeds from infected individuals have significantly shorter pappi and seed mid-lengths whilst having no significant difference in seed mass, indicating that seeds from infected hosts have altered growth form.

        "Comment": "A new model, RothPC-1, is described for the turnover of organic C in the top metre of soil. RothPC-1 is a version of RothC-26.3, an earlier model for the turnover of C in topsoils. In RothPC-1 two extra parameters are used to model turnover in the top metre of soil: one, p, which moves organic C down the profile by an advective process, and the other, s, which slows decomposition with depth. RothPC-1 is parameterized and tested using measurements (described in Part 1, this issue) of total organic C and radiocarbon on soil profiles from the Rothamsted long-term field experiments, collected over a period of more than 100 years. RothPC-1 gives fits to measurements of organic C and radiocarbon in the 0-23, 23-46, 46-69 and 69-92 cm layers of soil that are almost all within (or close to) measurement error in two areas of regenerating woodland (Geescroft and Broadbalk Wildernesses) and an area of cultivated land from the Broadbalk Continuous Wheat Experiment. The fits to old grassland (the Park Grass Experiment) are less close. Two other sites that provide the requisite pre- and post-bomb data are also fitted; a prairie Chernozem from Russia and an annual grassland from California. Roth-PC-1 gives a close fit to measurements of organic C and radiocarbon down the Chernozem profile, provided that allowance is made for soil age; with the annual grassland the fit is acceptable in the upper part of the profile, but not in the clay-rich Bt horizon below. Calculations suggest that treating the top metre of soil as a homogeneous unit will greatly overestimate the effects of global warming in accelerating the decomposition of soil C and hence on the enhanced release of CO2 from soil organic matter; more realistic estimates will be obtained from multi-layer models such as RothPC-1.",

These data were then fitted to a model in which soil organic matter was separated into five compartments: decomposable plant material (DPM, half-life 0.165 years); resistant plant material (RPM, 2.31 years); soil biomass (BIO, 1.69 years); physically stabilized organic matter (POM, 49.5 years) and chemically stabilized organic matter (COM, 1980 years) For unitary input of plant material (1 t fresh plant C ha-1 year-1) under steady-state conditions, after 10,000 years, the model predicts that the soil will contain 0.01 t C in DPM, 0.47 t in RPM, 0.28 t in BIO, 11.3 t in POM, and 12.2 t in COM. The predicted radiocarbon age is 1240 years (equivalent age). The fit between predicted and measured data is sufficiently good to suggest that the model is a useful representation of the turnover of organic matter in cropped soils.",

        "Comment": "Long-term datasets of integrated environmental variables, co-located together, are relatively rare. The UK Environmental Change Network (ECN) was launched in 1992 and provides the UK with its only long-term integrated environmental monitoring and research network for the assessment of the causes and consequences of environmental change. Measurements, covering a wide range of physical, chemical and biological \"driver\" and \"response\" variables are made in close proximity at ECN terrestrial sites using protocols incorporating standard quality control procedures. This paper describes the datasets (there are nineteen published ECN datasets) for these co-located measurements, containing over twenty years of data (1993\u20132015).

        "Comment": "This review identifies the major trends in physical, chemical and biological data between 1993 and 2007 at the 12 terrestrial sites in the United Kingdom Environmental Change Network (ECN) and assesses the effectiveness of the programme. Temperature and precipitation increased and sulphur (S) deposition decreased across the network. There were also significant local trends in nitrogen (N) deposition. The decreasing S deposition was associated with increasing pH of rainfall and soils and there was widespread evidence of soil pH showing recovery from acidification. Warm-adapted butterfly species tended to increase at northern, upland sites, consistent with an effect of increasing temperatures. In contrast, carabid beetle species associated with cooler northern and upland areas showed declining populations. The increasing trend in precipitation may account for a decline in ruderal plant species in the lowlands, reversing an increase associated with drought in the early part of the time series. There was no general shift in the composition of plant communities which might reflect rising soil pH. This may reflect the slow dynamics of plant community processes or a distinction between pH trends at the surface and lower soil horizons. The ECN is effective in detecting trends in a range of different variables at contrasting sites. Its strength is the ability to monitor causes and consequences of environmental change in the same programme, improving the ability to attribute causes of change, which is essential to developing conservation policy and management in the 21st century.

        "Comment": "The Rothamsted Estate in Hertfordshire, United Kingdom, is home to the longest running ecological and agricultural experiments in the world that have generated unique data sets on the assembly and functioning of ecosystems that stretch back more than 170 years. In addition, the Rothamsted Sample Archive contains over 300,000 samples of dried soil, herbage, straw and grain dating back to the start of the first experiments. Additional long-term experiments were set up in the mid-1900s and the systematic sampling of invertebrates at Rothamsted started in 1964, which continues to this day in the form of the Rothamsted Insect Survey. Here, we introduce the resources available at Rothamsted for research on ecological processes that can only be understood using data over long time periods. Rather than cataloguing all the work that has been done using the data, we focus on new advances made in the last decade in areas of environmental monitoring, community ecology, evolutionary biology, ecosystem stability and resilience and microbial ecology. The combination of long-term data sets with archived plant and soil samples together with new analytical techniques mean that the Rothamsted long-term experiments and insect collections continue to be as relevant and valuable to scientists today as when they were originally set up.",

        "Comment": "There has been recent interest in the use of surface-deployed geophysical methods to estimate soil moisture profiles. In this study, we applied multi-coil, frequency domain, electromagnetic induction (EMI) geophysical surveys to determine electrical conductivity (sigma) profiles of the root zone of four winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes grown in a randomized block experiment with four replicates. Field measurements of apparent electrical conductivity (sa) were obtained at sites with two different soil textures. We used the cumulative sensitivity model to predict EMI conductivity data from the conductivity profile measured with electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) on a subset of the plots we investigated. During the inversion of the EMI data, conductivities were adjusted on all plots so that they were consistent with the ERT data. Changes in electrical conductivity of field soil, with depth computed from inversion of the EMI data, during the growth period were compared with measured changes in soil water content. Laboratory measurements confirmed a positive correlation between electrical conductivity and soil water content. Between crop emergence and maturity, water extraction by the different wheat genotypes reduced the water content by up to 30% Comparing changes in electrical conductivity between reference profiles determined shortly after crop emergence and electrical conductivity profiles at later dates as the crop matured, we were able to use EMI to remotely monitor moisture extraction by the roots of different wheat genotypes with depth and time.",

        "Comment": "Research in agricultural systems occurs on a range of time spans. Some experiments are carried out for a single growing season while others are maintained with little change for decades. Data from short-term experiments are often used to extrapolate the results researchers would expect to see in the future. However, the response of soil properties, yields, and pests can change in unexpected ways. Long-term research is essential to determine how agricultural systems change over time. Measuring the same data for years, decades, and even centuries can help researchers build accurate models of long-term processes. Discussing several examples of long-term experiments with members of ASA, CSSA, and SSSA reveals common challenges in conducting long-term research and great optimism for these plots to continue. ",

Experiments to determine the effects of soil-borne pathogens, the effects of P and K accumulated in soil from fertilizers and manures, the efficient use of nitrogen fertilizers, and the fate of nitrogen in organic manures are described. The value of long-term experiments in assessing the effect of soil type and farming systems on soil organic matter is considered. The Park Grass experiment and the Rothamsted Insect Survey are described. The value of long-term experiments with respect to environmental concerns (soil pollution, organic pollutants, inorganic pollutants) is discussed. Approaches to new long-term experiments are considered.",

        "DOI": "The Woburn Ley-arable experiment is the oldest of its type in the UK, and data from it has been used widely. It is a complicated experiment, and there have been many changes over the years to cropping, fertilizer and farmyard manure (FYM) applications, to ensure its continued use and relevance to agricultural practice. It was designed initially to test the effects of rotations with or without leys (short-term herbage) on the yield of arable test crops. It is now an important resource for investigating long-term changes in soil organic matter (SOM) due to different cropping systems. It consists of 40 pairs of main plots, half of which are in \u2018Continuous Rotations\u2019, and half originally in \u2018Alternating Rotations\u2019. The Alternating Rotation plots gave little additional information, so they were replaced by longer term leys in 1973. Changes to the treatment rotations, test crops and lime, FYM and fertilizers applied over the years, are described here. This paper attempts to detail the important changes that have been made in the management of the Woburn Ley-arable experiment to ensure that it remains relevant to current issues in soil fertility, crop yield and carbon storage. A list of the major changes, in chronological order, is given in Appendix Table 3.",

Arable cropping in 1966 to 1971/2 or continuous leys in 1965 to 1971/2 is being followed by an arable rotation in 1972 to 1976. Annual balanced dressings of P, K and Mg have ensured that the nutrient status of the plots receiving organic manures and leys is the same as that of the control plots receiving mineral fertilizers. Little N was released from peat and straw in 1966 to 1971. Yields of barley and winter wheat were reasonably related to N release from green manures or farmyard manure. Yields of potatoes were larger after green manures, and yields of sugar beet were larger with farmyard manure than could be explained by the N released from these organic manures. After allowing for the extra N they released, all organic manures produced larger cumulative yields of dry matter than did equivalent rates of mineral fertilizers; the extra yields from farmyard manure were 10 to 12% greater than from fertilizers.<new para>ADDITIONAL ABSTRACT:<new para>Arable cropping in 1966-71/2 or continuous leys in 1965-71/2 were followed by an arable rotation (potatoes/winter wheat/sugar beet/barley) to evaluate OM accumulated during the arable cropping or leys.

        "Comment": "Phosphorus (P) fertilizer recommendations of individual countries may differ in many aspects, but often the main principle is to reach or maintain a target range of plant-available P in soil. Within this target P fertility class, the soil is expected to supply enough P to the crop, while P fertilization replaces what is exported by the harvested crop. However, the threshold values of the target P fertility classes are based on a multitude of different soil test P (STP) methods and vary by a factor of up to three, even for countries using the same STP method. This study aimed to provide a comparison of the thresholds of target P fertility classes of different European countries and critical soil test P values (Pcrit; STP below which the average relative yield falls below 95% due to P insufficiency) derived from the analysis of data from 55 long-term field experiments in eight European countries. To overcome the issue of diverging STP methods, all values were converted to Olsen-P using empirically based conversion equations from the literature. Converted threshold values varied by a factor of up to five. For the experimental data, we fitted multi-level Mitscherlich-type models to determine Pcrit values of unfertilized soils corresponding to 95% of maximum yield. We found an average Olsen-Pcrit value of 15\u00a0mg\u00a0P\u00a0kg?1 (adj. R\u00b2 = 0.37; RMSE = 14.1% relative yield; n\u00a0=\u00a02368; 55 experiments), which lies far below several country-specific thresholds of target P fertility classes. Crop-specific analyses resulted in higher Olsen-Pcrit values for sugar beet (22\u00a0mg\u00a0P\u00a0kg?1), potato (19\u00a0mg\u00a0P\u00a0kg?1) and winter rapeseed (18\u00a0mg\u00a0P\u00a0kg?1). Among the texture classes (loam, sand, silt and clay), sandy soils exhibited the highest average Olsen-Pcrit value (22\u00a0mg\u00a0P\u00a0kg?1). We consider a reevaluation of extraordinarily high country-specific thresholds as well as an inclusion of crop type and soil texture (where not already implemented) to be a reasonable measure towards more cost-effective and environment-friendly P fertilization.",

        "Comment": "Tillage and crop residue management both influence the losses of nutrients and crop-protection chemicals from the soil to the aqueous environment. Tillage is performed to control weeds, to modify the soil structure and often to incorporate straw, which can no longer be burnt in European Community countries. The resulting changes in the soil alter both the pathways for water flow and the activities of microbes. This paper reviews their effects on water movement and the microbial and physico-chemical processes that influence the vulnerabilities of nutrients and crop-protection chemicals to leaching. It also suggests some possible options for limiting losses of these substances from the soil. There remains considerable scope for cooperation between tillage specialists and those with an interest in the management of nutrients and crop-protection chemicals.",

        "Comment": "Abstract Soil archives preserve a snapshot of soils from a specific time and location, allowing researchers to re-evaluate soils of the past in the context of the present for an improved understanding of long-term soil change. To date, the extent of soil archive use in the peer-reviewed literature is poorly inventoried. Here, we document the characteristics and distribution of global soil archive use, as found in 245 publications, following an exhaustive search of English language journals. Soil archive use has increased substantially since 1980, reaching 59 publications between 2016 and 2020. The age of soil archives across the compilation ranged from 5 to 160 yr, with mean and median archive ages of 48 and 37 yr, respectively. Publications using soil archives originated mostly from countries in the northern hemisphere, with the top five reporting countries including the United States (61), United Kingdom (52), New Zealand (21), Canada (18), and China (14). Land uses associated with soil archive publications were dominated by agroecosystems, specifically land planted to annual crops. Forty-seven percent of investigations focused on changes in soil C, N, or organic matter, whereas investigations of other subjects did not exceed 20% each. The compilation is publicly available online. As demands on soils increase, archives will serve as an invaluable tool for understanding long-term soil change in the Anthropocene era. Multiregional coordination and increased investment in curation and retention of soil archives are recommended to preserve these irreplaceable resources.",

Vegetation can therefore be a useful indicator of the changing atmospheric burden of POPS. Samples of archived pasture, collected from Rothamsted Experimental Station in the United Kingdom between 1930 and 2004, were analyzed for a range of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). PBDEs could not be routinely detected in the pre-1970 samples. Thereafter, the dominant congeners BDE 28, 47, 49, 99, 100, 153, 154, and 183 were frequently detected. The general trend was (a) a rise through the 1970s; (b) a minipeak in the mid-1980s, strongly influenced by one particularly high sample for 1984; (c) values remaining high through the late 1980s/1990s; (d) an indication of a more recent decline for all congeners (except BDE-28), consistent with recent restrictions on PBDE usage in Europe. These trends were compared to recent modeled estimates of U.K. PBDE emissions. The congener profiles of technical mixtures, U.K. air, soil, and pasture were compared and shown to be broadly similar. The implications for environmental release mechanisms are discussed.",

        "Comment": "Archived wheat grain and straw samples from the unfertilized plot of the Broadbalk Continuous Wheat Experiment at Rothamsted, England, were used to investigate the trends in stable C isotope ratios since 1845. Grain delta 13C was higher than straw delta 13C. Both grain and straw delta 13C have decreased by approximately 2.5-2.8 per mil over the last 153 years, and since the 1960s the decrease has been more rapid than the decrease of the delta 13C of atmospheric CO2. The C isotope discrimination ( DELTA ), and hence the ratio of CO2 concentration in leaf intercellular space to that in the ambient air (ci/ca), remained relatively stable or decreased slightly between 1845 and the mid-1960s, then increased considerably. The period with increasing DELTA and ci/ca corresponds to the introduction of the modern short-straw cultivars of wheat. When grown on the unfertilized plot in the same seasons, a modern wheat cultivar had slightly higher DELTA values than an old cultivar. The ci derived from both grain and straw DELTA have increased by 33-37% over the last 153 years, with the increase being more rapid after than before the mid-1960s. However, there was no clear trend in the yields of straw and grain, primarily because of the limitations of N and other nutrients, and also because of large year-to-year variations.",

        "Comment": "Yields from five of the plots on the Park Grass Continuous Hay experiment at Rothamsted, started in 1856, were examined to see if any long-term trends could be detected over the last 100 years. Three of the plots examined are unfertilized; two receive inorganic nutrients every year; all are harvested twice a year. In 1959 the harvesting procedure was changed: yields for the periods before and after this change were examined separately and together. On none of the three unfertilized plots was the slope of the regression of total yield (i.e. first and second cuts combined) on time significantly (P < 0.05) different from zero in either the 1891-1958 or 1960-1992 periods. On both the fertilized plots, there were significant declines in yield with time over the 1960-92 period, assuming that the effects of autocorrelation are sufficiently small to be ignored; there were no consistent changes between 1891 and 1958. There were some significant trends on the five plots when the two cuts were considered separately. A linear regression model was fitted to the data in an attempt to separate the effects of meteorological variables (rainfall and sunshine hours over selected parts of the year) on total yield from possible long-term effects brought about, for example, by the increasing concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. On four of the five plots this model accounted for between 12 and 21 % of the yield variance in the pre- 1 959 period and between 45 and 63 % after 1960. On the fifth plot, which received the highest level of N, the model accounted for 29 % of the variance in the first period but only for 16 % in the second period. When a linear trend with time was included in the model, this was not significant on any of the plots over the entire 1891-1992 period, although some significant trends appeared when the two periods were considered separately. The model was also fitted with the atmospheric CO2 concentration in place of the linear trend with time: again there were no consistent trends. Neither changes in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere over the last century nor increasing inputs of combined N in rainfall or in dry deposition have had any detectable effects on yield in these plots.",

        "Comment": "The purpose of this paper is to determine the effect of soil type and organic matter on the deformation characteristics of soil. We used triaxial testing to measure both the consolidation and shear deformation of soil. The novel application of this method was applied to soils from two experiments: on a clay loam and a sandy loam. The clay loam soil was from the long-term Broadbalk Experiment at Rothamsted Research, UK, where contrasting treatments had been applied since 1843. The sandy loam soil was from a straw incorporation experiment started in 1986. The clay loam soil from selected treatments from the Broadbalk Experiment had large difference in soil organic C (SOC) content due to additions of farmyard manure (FYM) or inorganic fertilizers for over 170 yr. There were no detectable differences in SOC or microbial biomass C in the sandy loam soil where straw had been incorporated. In addition to triaxial testing, we assessed soil physical condition with measurements of aggregate stability and aggregate tensile strength. From triaxial tests of the repacked soil, we found that soil type and SOC affected the compression characteristics. We also observed that deformation characteristics are more sensitive to small changes in soil management practices designed to increase the SOC content, than measurements of aggregate tensile strength, friability, or stability. We suggest that measurement of deformation characteristics is a potentially powerful approach for detecting or predicting changes in soil physical conditions as impacted by small changes in SOC content resulting from management practices.",

        "Comment": "The turnover times of soil microbial biomass carbon (biomass C) and phosphorus (biomass P) were estimated from the declines in biomass C-14 and P-32 following the addition to soil of C-14-labelled glucose with added (KH2PO4)-P-32 or with the separate addition of ryegrass which had been doubly labelled with Co-14(2) and (KH2PO4)-P-32 (both at 1000 mug C and about 10 mug added P g(-1) soil). The labelled substrates were added separately to an UK grassland soil which was then incubated for 60 days at 25 degreesC and 40% water holding capacity. Addition of P-32 caused a considerable displacement (up to 60%) of non-labelled P in the biomass of soils also given glucose. There was also significant displacement of non-labelled biomass P in soils given P-32, only. With ryegrass, the labelled P addition increased the total biomass P pool size, rather than displacing native biomass P. However, with biomass C the increase in total biomass C pool size was larger than the displacement of original biomass C at this relatively low addition of substrate C. Under the above incubation conditions biomass C had a turnover time of about 82 days for glucose and 95 days for ryegrass. The turnover times of biomass P for glucose was about 37 and 42 days for ryegrass. The much shorter turnover time of biomass P than C may be because P is much more labile within the microbial cell than C. For example, unlike C, little P is generally located in the cell walls of micro-organisms, which turnover more slowly than the cytoplasmic components. These results illustrate the large potential of biomass P turnover as a source of P for plants, particularly in 'low input' systems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "Comment": "In this paper we follow the fate of single applications of (15)N-labeled fertilizer to old grassland, over a period of nearly 20 yr. In 1980 and 1981, (15)N-labeled N was applied to two of the treatments on the Park Grass Continuous Hay Experiment at Rothamsted, started in 1856. The labeled N was applied at the same rate (nominally 96 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and in the same chemical form (NH(4) or NO(3)) as the unlabeled N normally applied as fertilizer to the selected treatments. After 19 yr, 69.6% of the N applied in 1980 as (15)NH(4) had been harvested in successive cuts of herbage, with a further 16.5% remaining in the soil. For (15)NO(3), 64.3% had been harvested and 13.8% remained in the soil. The (15)N data were then used to calculate annual inputs of nonfertilizer N, annual losses of N and N turnover times in old grassland, assuming that the selected treatments were under steady-state conditions. The annual input of N from nonfertilizer sources (rain, dry deposition, N fixation by leguminous components of the herbage, etc.) was large: 39 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for the NH(4) treatment and 31 kg for the NO(3) treatment. Leguminous plants made up <2% of the herbage in both the NH(4) and NO(3) treatments. The annual loss from the NH(4) treatment was 19 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and 24 from the NO(3) treatment. The gross turnover time of N in the root compartment (which included plant crowns) was 1.41 yr for the NH(4) treatment and 0.42 yr for NO(3). The gross turnover time of soil microbial N was 2.13 yr (NH(4)) and 1.83 yr (NO(3)): for humus N (i.e., soil N not in roots or microbial biomass) it was 181 yr (NH(4)) and 116 yr (NO(3)).",

The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems) multi-spectral imagery (480\u20131000 nm) for estimating the SOC content in bare cultivated soils at a high spatial resolution (12 cm).We performed UAS analysis on the Hoosfield Spring Barley experiment at Rothamsted (UK) where adjacent plots with distinctly different SOC contents, due to different long-term management practices, provide a valuable resource to evaluate this approach. We acquired images (wavelength: 480\u2013550\u2013670\u2013780\u2013880\u20131000 nm) at an altitude of 120 m over an area of 2 ha using a multi-spectral camera mounted on an UAS. The high-resolution images captured smallscale variations at the soil surface (e.g. shadows, tillage andwheels marks). After a projection in newdimensions by a PCA, we calibrated a support vector machine regression using observations fromconventional soil sampling and SOC measurements. The performance of the calibration had a R2 of 0.98 and a RMSE of 0.17%C. A cross-validation showed that the model was robust, with an average R2 of 0.95 and a RMSE of 0.21%. An external validation dataset was used to evaluate the predicted spatial patterns of SOC content and a good fit with an RMSE 0.26%C was obtained. Although this study shows that the methodology has a clear potential for use in precision agriculture or monitoring important soil properties following changes in management,we also identify and discuss its limitations and current shortcomings.",

        "Comment": "We assess the random and systematic uncertainties affecting the central England temperature (CET) record since 1878 on daily, monthly and annual time scales. The largest contribution to uncertainty in CET on all these time scales arises from areal sampling, followed, for annual and monthly CET by thermometer calibration. For the daily series, random thermometer precision and screen errors are the second largest source of uncertainty. Annual CETs are least uncertain, whereas daily CETs are most uncertain. Despite the uncertainties in annual mean CET, the trend of 0.077 degrees C per decade since 1900 is significant at the 1% level. In an additional investigation, we detect biases in the published series of central England maximum and minimum temperatures, and implement systematic adjustments of up to +/- 0.2 degrees C to the values up to 1921 and up to +/- 0.1 degrees C to the values since 1980. These adjustments are of opposite sign in maximum and minimum temperature, so they do not affect mean CET, but they improve the homogeneity of the diurnal temperature range, which then shows little trend before 1980 and a reduced rising trend thereafter. The uncertainties in maximum and minimum temperature make the data inadequate for the task of establishing the magnitude of the recent increase of diurnal range. (C) Crown Copyright 2005.

        "Comment": "Many pollinating insects, across taxa and regions, have declined during the twentieth century. Amongst the drivers of these trends, soil eutrophication and acidification caused by nitrogen (N) have not been broadly researched. Anthropogenic influences have greatly increased the global deposition of N to soils during the past century; this is increasingly recognised as a threat to global biodiversity. The fundamental role of soil in plant growth and health means that alterations to soil conditions will likely have consequences for plant\u2013pollinator interactions. Soil N can be a substantial driver of the species structure of botanical communities, often reducing species richness due to quick growth of competitive grasses. Floral traits, relevant to pollinators, such as phenology, morphology, and nectar and pollen production and quality can also be affected by soil N. We currently lack sufficient research to determine if and how pollinators will be impacted by these changes. This review collates the research and evidence of how soil N affects botanical species composition and relevant floral traits, and discusses how pollinating insects and plant\u2013pollinator interactions might be impacted. We conclude by identifying the key knowledge gaps in this subject; the lack of research that includes the pollinators into studies of how N additions affect botanical traits, poor understanding of inter-specific variation in botanical responses to N, synthesis of botanical traits to form a comprehensive understanding, and the inclusion of other abiotic and biotic drivers into studies.",

        "Comment": "RATIONALE The spatial variability of soil properties is poorly understood, despite its importance in designing appropriate experimental sampling strategies. As preparation for a farm-scale agro-ecosystem services monitoring project, the 'North Wyke Farm Platform', there was a need to assess the spatial variability of key soil chemical and physical properties. METHODS The field-scale spatial variability of soil chemical (total N, total C, soil organic matter), soil physical properties (bulk density and particle size distribution) and stable isotope ratios (d13C and d15N values) was studied using geostatistical approaches in an intensively managed grassland. RESULTS The scales over which stable isotopes vary (ranges: 212258 m) were larger than those of the total nutrients, soil organic matter and bulk density (ranges: 84170 m). Two visually and statistically distinct areas of Great Field (north and south) were identified in terms of co-occurring high/low values of several soil properties. CONCLUSIONS The resulting patterns of spatial variability suggest lower spatial variability of stable isotopes than that of total nutrients, soil organic matter and bulk density. Future sampling regimes should be conducted in a grid with <85 m distance between sampling locations to sufficiently capture the spatial variability of the measured soil properties on the 'North Wyke Farm Platform'. Consultation of the management histories of the sampled field revealed that it had previously comprised two fields with contrasting management histories, suggesting an effect of management legacy (>5 years) on the patterns of spatial variability.

        "Comment": "Global nitrogen (N) deposition has risen steeply since the mid-19th Century and is forecasted to rise further. This increased flux of N to ecosystems is increasingly considered as a worldwide driver of environmental change. Impacts to botanical communities have been shown across a range of ecosystems and regions, but evidence on consequential impacts to further trophic levels is currently limited. Our understanding of how N affects plant-pollinator interactions is relatively poor. Declining trends in pollinating insects have been widely reported during recent decades and a key factor in this is losses of floral resources. The research chapters presented in this thesis seek to address the wide knowledge gap of how N affects pollinators by investigating how soil N affects 1) the composition of floral functional traits in a plant community, 2) intra-specific variation in key floral functional traits: phenology and nectar, and 3) the potential impacts to plant-pollinator interaction networks. This research was undertaken using the Park Grass Long-term Experiment (PGE) at Rothamsted Research, UK, a long-term nutrientenrichment experiment. The study found extensive impacts of N on the provision of floral resources. Floral resources were lost with N-enrichment, with morphologically specialised floral units particularly threatened. Flowering phenology of plant species was influenced by N-enrichment with a notable contrast between early-season species, which had an extended flowering duration, and peak-season species that had a reduced flowering duration. Responses of nectar traits varied across species but were shown to respond to N applications. The observed pollinator visitation networks were impacted by the soil treatments; N additions typically led to Diptera dominant communities and networks that were potentially less robust to stochastic events. The research project provided evidence that soil N can act as an underlying driver of plantpollinator networks and should be considered as a factor in pollinator ecology and trends.  ",

        "Comment": "Crop yields are affected by many variables. In the context of climate change, higher temperatures tend to reduce yield. The Rothamsted Long-Term Experiments on winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) (in Broadbalk), spring barley (Hordeum vulgare) (Hoosfield), and herbage (Park Grass) are some of the world\u2019s oldest continuous agricultural experiments. This Thesis investigates inter-annual variability in yield in the response to climate change, and principally, variations in weather. A multivariate approach to quantify climate change was developed in which 10 different clusters of similar annual weather characteristics from 1892 to 2016 were identified. Most years in the 21st century had their own distinct cluster of a generally warmer climate, which occurred infrequently in the 20th century. FYM treatments of wheat and barley from these warm and dry years had a total biomass of 3.05 and 1.18 t ha-1 lower compared to years from a typical 20th century climate. Between-year variations in temperature and rainfall were associated with variations in the yield of wheat, barley and forage. Warmer temperatures in the early-summer were shown to have a negative effect on the yield of cereal crops. By modelling variations in a Nitrogen response curve, annual yields of wheat and spring barley to Nitrogen were also influenced by variations in rainfall and temperature, where warmer temperatures reduced asymptotic yield of the response to Nitrogen. Simulated wheat yields were estimated to increase by 9.12 to 9.87% from 1892 to 2016 due to rises in atmospheric CO2 when all other variables were fixed, but this effect was largely negated by the actual rise in temperature over this period. The Rothamsted Long-Term Experiment data provided a unique insight into the association between weather and yield and potential mitigations to increase food production. The statistical approaches developed within this Thesis may be applied to other long-term crop-weather datasets. ",

        "Comment": "Archived soil and herbage samples from the control plot of the Rothamsted Park Grass Experiment, established in 1856, were used to investigate the effects of dramatically changing SO2 pollution inputs on the concentrations and stable isotope ratios of S in the samples. Both herbage S concentrations and delta(34)S showed clear trends over the last 135 years. Herbage S concentrations correlated positively with annual total SO2 emissions in the U.K. (R-2 = 0.61), whereas herbage delta(34)S correlated negatively with SO2 emissions (R-2 = 0.83). These results indicate that local variations of anthropogenic S inputs were not important at the site and verify the usefulness of this unique sample set for environmental monitoring. in contrast, the concentrations of total and extractable S in the topsoil were less sensitive to the changing pollution, although the delta(34)S values of sail S also decreased significantly, particularly during the period 1900-1970. Based on these S isotope ratios, we estimated that anthropogenic S contributed up to 50% of the herbage S uptake at the peak of SO2 emissions and still accounts for about 30% of the S presently stored in the topsoil.",

        "Comment": "The intensification of crop management in the U.K. over the past 60 years has resulted in the decline of the Populations of a number of annual plant species adapted to arable habitats. In contrast, other species continue to be common as arable weeds. A Community assembly approach was taken to explain these recent changes in the weed flora using databases of plant functional traits, a pot experiment, and weed surveys OF the Broadbalk long-term experiment. The hypothesis was tested that species that have been selected against by increased fertilizer inputs and herbicide use share an adverse combination of traits. An analysis comparing the combination Of Maximum height, seed weight, and time of first flowering of 29 common and 32 rare or threatened U.K. autumn weeds established that rare or threatened species Occupied an area of trait space that was distinct from the common species. A rare weed trait syndrome of short stature, large seed, and late flowering was identified. The theory that species with a trait syndrome that is Currently unfavorable are better adapted for less fertile environments was Supported by the pot experiment. Species with a combination of short stature and large seed had a relatively greater competitive ability in low compared to high fertility treatments. Analysis of survey data from the Broadbalk long-term experiment confirmed that, as N inputs increased, the abundance of the two functional groups that contained only common species remained stable or increased; whereas, the groups dominated by rare or threatened species declined as fertility increased. An understanding of the response traits of arable plants to management filters, including fertilizer inputs and herbicide, is valuable for designing conservation strategies for rare species or predicting Future shifts in the functional diversity of weed communities including the potential for invasive species to establish.",

        "Comment": "Predicting the response of biological communities to changes in the environment or management is a fundamental pursuit of community ecology. Meeting this challenge requires the integration of multiple processes: habitat filtering, niche differentiation, biotic interactions, competitive exclusion, and stochastic demographic events. Most approaches to this long-standing problem focus either on the role of the environment, using trait-based filtering approaches, or on quantifying biotic interactions with process-based community dynamics models. We introduce a novel approach that uses functional traits to parametrise a process-based model. By combining the two approaches we make use of the extensive literature on traits and community filtering as a convenient means of reducing the parametrisation requirements of a complex population dynamics model whilst retaining the power to capture the processes underlying community assembly. Using arable weed communities as a case study, we demonstrate that this approach results in predictions that show realistic distributions of traits and that trait selection predicted by our simulations is consistent with in-field observations. We demonstrate that trait-based filtering approaches can be combined with process-based models to derive the emergent distribution of traits. While initially developed to predict the impact of crop management on functional shifts in weed communities, our approach has the potential to be applied to other annual plant communities if the generality of relationships between traits and model parameters can be confirmed.",

Of all the scenarios investigated the extensification scenario used the largest number of assumptions, was the most reliant upon suitability of soil types and climate, and had potential benefits such as improved animal welfare and reduced requirements for organic fertilizers.

        "Comment": "The most well-known long-term field experiments in the world are those at the Rothamsted Experiment Station in the UK. The Broadbalk Experiment, initiated in 1843, is now more than 165 yr old. Several long-term experiments also continue in the United States. Two of the most famous are the Morrow Plots in Illinois and Sanborn Field in Missouri. Some scientists and administrators have repeatedly questioned the reasons for continuing these experiments. The basic questions remain the same, whether the year is 1895 when Lawes and Gilbert responded to a challenge about the value of their long-term experiments, or whether it is 2012 and modern-day administrators are seeking ways to decrease costs. The questions are: \"Are these experiments worth the cost?\" and \"Are we still learning something from them?\" These questions are raised more frequently as research budgets become more tenuous. So, why write another paper regarding the value of long-term field research? Do costly long-term field experiments have any value relative to what some would label \"cutting edge\" research? Our objective is to use the history and scientific contributions of a more recently established (1970) long-term soil management experiment at the University of Nebraska High Plains Agricultural Laboratory to provide modern evidence that maintaining existing long-term field experiments, and initiating new ones, remains a valuable and critical investment. We show how an experiment conceived to study one objective has impacted numerous other pertinent issues during the last 40 yr. We argue that scientists and administrators should be protecting existing long-term field experiments and establishing new ones to address current research issues.",

        "Comment": "13C-labelled glucose was applied to arable (Broadbalk NPK) and permanent grassland (Woburn Grassland) soils to investigate the response of the soil microbial biomass (SMB) to carbon (C) applied at trace concentrations. Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) were used as biomarkers for G+ve (odd-chained and iso/anteiso FA) and G-ve bacteria (mono-unsaturated and cyclic FA), actinobacteria (10-methyl-branched FA), fungi (octadecadienoic acid) and general membrane lipids [16:0,18:0]. Gas chromatography-combustion-stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS) was used to determine the incorporation of 13C into individual PLFA in two experiments: first, after application of a single concentration (15 mu g C g-1) of 13C-glucose over a time sequence (0, 8, 24, 48, 120 and 240 hours), and second after application at three concentrations (25, 83, 416 mu g C g-1 soil after 120 hours). 13C incorporation into PLFA over time was similar in both soils. However, in the permanent grassland soil, 13C incorporation was increased in actinobacteria PLFA at 120 hours when [16:0,18:0] was reduced. At 240 hours, 13C incorporation increased in [16:0,18:0] concurrently with a reduction in G+ve bacteria PLFA. Increasing glucose concentration caused different responses in the SMB of both soils. In the arable soil, all biomarker PLFA concentrations increased at all rates of application. In contrast, in the permanent grassland soil PLFA concentrations were similar to the control in all SMB groups, except G+ve bacteria after the greatest rate of application. However, the delta 13C values of the same PLFA indicated that uptake of applied 13C-glucose was proportional to the applied concentration in all groups of soil bacteria in both soils.",

        "Comment": "Dry weight, nutrient content and other properties of winter wheat were measured from anthesis to maturity between 1969 and 1984. From 1969 to 1978 the cultivar Capelle- Desprez was grown either as a first wheat, in the rotation potatoes, beans, wheat, or as a second wheat, in the rotation fallow, wheat, wheat. From 1979 to 1984 the cv. Flanders was grown in the rotation fallow, potatoes, wheat and in this period the wheat was given fungicide sprays. Grain yield of Cappelle-Desprez grown as a first wheat was greater with 96 than with 144 kg N/ha in spring. First wheats yielded much more than second wheats with 96, but not with 144 kg N/ha. Second wheats had more eyespot and take-all, but less mildew, than first wheats. Mildew was more severe with the larger amount of N. Grain yield of Flanders as a first wheat was greater than that of Cappelle-Desprez. Yield of Flanders was greater with 144 than with 96 kg N/ha and it was greater still on plots given 96 kg Nha plus 35 t/ha farmyard manure. Other properties in addition to grain yield were changed by cultivar, rotation and manuring. Examination of the variation between years showed relationships among properties and between some of them and grain yield. Many of the relationships were independent of cultivar or husbandry. Relationships between weather factors and some properties, but not grain yield, were detected. Grain yield of first wheats was closely related to number of grains/m2, but the relative importance of number of ears/m2 and number of grains per ear varied from year to year. Yield was positively related to dry weight per grain in Flanders, but negatively in Cappelle-Desprez. The weight of straw was usually less than that of the total above-ground crop at anthesis, but varied between years in a similar manner. The amount of N in grain plus straw was generally well related to the amount of N in the wheat at anthesis, although the changes in N content after anthesis ranged from a loss of 9 kg/ha to a gain of 51 kg/ha. The uptake of N, P and K was more closely related to dry weight than to nutrient concentration. Variation between years in the proportion in the ear of 14C supplied to the flag leaf was similar to that of 14C supplied to the next lower leaf, but was different for 14C supplied before and after anthesis, and did not relate to other properties.  Date of anthesis ranged from 7 June to 5 July. A model incorporating responses to photoperiod, vernalization and temperature accounted for 78% of the variance in date of anthesis. The duration of the period from anthesis to leaf senescence ranged from 33 to 60 days and was linearly related to mean temperature above a base of 7\u00b75 \u00b0C. Dry weight per grain was negatively correlated with mean temperature between anthesis and leaf senescence; a relationship including an adjustment for number of grains/m2 fitted both cultivars. The amount of N in grain plus straw and percentage of N in grain dry matter were decreased by increased rainfall during the 3-week period following the application of N fertilizer in spring. An additional 10 mm of rain decreased N uptake by 2\u20138 kg/ha and N percentage by 0\u00b7055. N uptake in grain plus straw decreased with progressively later sowing. Grain N% was positively correlated with temperature and with radiation during parts of the period of grain growth, but only 10% of the variance was accounted for by the combined effects. ",

        "Comment": "Studies of the wild grass Anthoxanthum odoratum at the long-term Park Grass Experiment (PGE, Harpenden, UK) document a well-known example of rapid plant evolution in response to environmental change. Repeated fertilizer applications have acidified the soil in some experimental plots over the past 150+ years, and Anthoxanthum subpopulations have quickly become locally adapted. Early reciprocal transplants showed subpopulation differentiation specifically in response to soil aluminium (Al) toxicity across the experiment, even at small (30m) spatial scales. Almost 40years after its original measurement, we reassessed the degree of local adaptation to soil Al at the PGE using updated phenotyping methods and identified genes with variation linked to the tolerance trait. Root growth assays show that plants are locally adapted to soil Al at both the seedling and adult growth stages, but to a smaller extent than previously inferred. Among a large suite of candidate loci that were previously shown to have Al-sensitive expression differences between sensitive and tolerant plants, three loci contained SNPs that are associated with both Al tolerance and soil acidity: an Al-sensitive malate transporter (ALMT), a tonoplast intrinsic protein (TIP) and the putative homolog of the rice cell-wall modification gene STAR1. Natural genetic variation at these loci is likely to have contributed to the recent rapid evolution at PGE. Continued study of Al tolerance variants in Anthoxanthum will allow us to test hypotheses about the nature and source of genetic variation that enables some species to adapt to soil acidification and other types of rapid environmental change.

        "Comment": "Relationships between take-all intensity and grain yield and quality were determined in field experiments on cereal crops using regression analyses, usually based on single-point disease assessments made during anthesis or grain-filling. Different amounts of take-all were achieved by different methods of applying inoculum artificially (to wheat only) or by using different cropping sequences (in wheat, triticale or barley) or sowing dates (wheat only) in crops with natural inoculum. Regressions of yield or thousand-grain weight on take-all intensity during grain filling were similar to those on accumulated disease (area under the disease progress curve) when these were compared in one of the wheat experiments. Regressions of yield on take-all intensity were more often significant in wheat than in the less susceptible crops, triticale and barley, even when a wide range of disease intensities was present in the latter crops. The regressions usually had most significance when there were plots in the severe disease category. Thousand-grain weight and hectolitre weight usually responded similarly to total grain yield. Decreased yield was often accompanied by a significant increase in the percentage of small grains. When severe take-all was present in wheat, regressions showed that nitrogen uptake was usually impaired. This was sometimes accompanied, however, by increased percentage nitrogen in the grain as a consequence of smaller grain size with decreased endosperm. Significant effects of take-all, both positive and negative, on Hagberg falling number in wheat sometimes occurred. Significant regressions of yield on take-all assessed earlier than usual, ie during booting rather than grain-filling in wheat and triticale and during anthesis/grain-filling rather than ripening in barley, had steeper slopes. This is consistent with observations that severe disease that develops early can be particularly damaging, whilst the crops, especially barley, can later express tolerance by producing additional, healthy roots. The regression parameters, including maximum potential yield (y-axis intercept) and the extrapolated maximum yield loss, also varied according to the different growing conditions, including experimental treatments and other husbandry operations. These differences must be considered when assessing the economic potential of a control measure such as fungicidal seed treatment. (C) 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.",

        "Comment": "The rate of methane oxidation has been measured from under a variety of land uses and management practices on Rothamsted Experimental Station. All these sites have their management histories well documented, in many cases over centuries, and experience the same atmospheric inputs. We have found consistent patterns in methane oxidation rates associated with land use, where the rate of methane oxidation in unfertilized arable soil (c. 30 mu g CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) is only 15 % that in undisturbed grassland and woodland soils (c. 200 mu g CH4 m(-2) d(-1)). Investigation of the mechanisms regulating these differences have shown that they are microbially mediated. The microbial basis for differences in methane uptake rates are unclear, but probably involve three groups of microorganism, methanogens, methanotrophs and ammonia oxidisers. Using traditional enumeration techniques we show that soils under grassland and woodland have similar numbers of bacteria and also similar numbers of putative methane oxidisers (organisms of unknown identity, that can oxidise methane), but that an unfertilized arable soil has significant lower total bacterial numbers and also putative methane oxidisers. This study is extended to compare the capacities of the soils under the different land uses to metabolise multi-carbon compounds in addition to methane. Using a modification of the Biolog<reg> technique we demonstrate that the microbial populations in the soil under the woodland and grassland can metabolise a greater range of carbon compounds compared to the arable soil, as well as having higher methane oxidising capabilities.",

        "Comment": "Broadbalk and Geescroft Wildernesses were abandoned as arable fields in the 1880s and allowed to develop with little further direct human intervention. Both have now developed into mature mixed deciduous woodland, variants of National Vegetation Classification type W8, Fraxinus excelsior - Acer campestre - Mercurialis perennis woodland. In addition, a portion of Broadbalk Wilderness has been maintained as grassland by removing woody colonists and, latterly, by grazing. The succession from arable to woodland has been recorded at irregular intervals for more than 100 years. Despite its limitations, this is the longest record of the floristic development of secondary woodland on farmland in the UK. Woody species colonised Broadbalk within 10 years, but at Geescroft they were not recorded until 30 years after abandonment. At present, both sites have good overstorey canopies with well developed understories which provide densely shaded conditions. There are currently 17 species of shrubs and trees at each site. The transition from a flora of mainly light-demanding species to shade tolerant species took place within 20-40 years of abandonment. The development of the shade flora within the woods has been characterised by: (1) a high turnover of species; (2) a failure to colonise by some shade-bearing species in the vicinity; and (3) inability of some colonists to spread beyond the wood margins. This appeared to be associated with: (1) dense shade from the closed woodland canopy; (2) competition from established ground flora dominants, particularly Hedera helix; (3) lack of suitable moist soils and open space habitats within the woods; and (4) pronounced acidification of soils in one wood. Some implications for new farm woodland creation are discussed. Crown Copyright \u00a9 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "Comment": "From 1941-1944 nearly 30 phytosociological releves were completed by F. K. Hartmann in the Rychlebske Mountains, a typical mountainous area in northeastern Czech Republic. Of the original plots still covered with adult grown beech (Fagus sylvatica) forest, 22 were resampled in 1998 and 1999. In order to describe the recent vegetation variability of the sites 57 releves were recorded. Changes in vegetation were estimated using relative changes in species density and ordinations (PCA, RDA). Environmental changes were assessed using Ellenberg indicator values when no direct measurements were available. A decline in species diversity has been documented, particularly, many species occurring frequently in deciduous forests with nutrient and moisture well-supplied soils around neutral have decreased. In contrast, several light-demanding, acid- and soil desiccation-tolerant species have increased. Natural succession, quantified as forest age, contributed slightly to these changes. In Ellenberg indicator values, a decline in F (soil moisture), R (soil calcium) and N (ecosystem productivity), and an increase in L (understorey light) were shown. This is interpreted as the influence of modified forestry management and of airborne pollutants. Intensified logging caused the canopy to open and soil conditions to worsen. The latter is most likely also due to acid leaching of soil cations (Ca, K, Na). This caused a decline in soil productivity, thus the effect of nitrification could not be detected. The original releves may have differed in size influencing the results.",

        "Comment": "Recent carbon inventories have shown that significant amounts of soil organic matter (SOM), even though at low concentrations, can be stored in the subsoil (B and C horizons). Its quantity, turnover and chemical composition are largely unknown. The objective of the present study was to analyse the organic matter in the mineral horizons of two forest soils with different pedogenetic history and to assess the quantity, turnover and chemical composition of SOM stored in the subsoil compared to the topsoil (A horizon and litter layers). Samples were taken from a Dystric Cambisol under beech and a Haplic Podzol under spruce forest down to a depth of 140 and 80 cm, respectively. They were analysed for elemental composition, carbon storage and chemical structure of SOM by C-13 CPMAS NMR spectroscopy, radiocarbon age by accelerator mass spectrometry and plant derived phenols as well as hydroxyalkanoic acids by CuO oxidation. Special attention was drawn to the contribution of phenols and hydroxyalkanoic acids, because they are major contributors of root litter. Up to 75% of the organic carbon present in the mineral soil of the two profiles was found below the A horizon. Radiocarbon measurements showed that the organic carbon in the subsoil had an apparent age of several thousand years. The structural analyses indicated a similar chemical composition of the organic matter present in the litter layers of both soils. In the mineral soils, the chemical composition of the SOM differed according to the pedogenetic processes operating at the two sites. A high contribution of alkyl carbon was recorded in the B horizons of the Dystric Cambisol which may be partly explained by the contribution of hydroxyalkanoic acids which are preserved preferentially in this soil compared to phenols. In the Haplic Podzol, spectra of the B horizons indicate a higher contribution of O-alkyl and carboxylic carbon due to carbon leaching during podzolisation. In the C horizons of both soils, most of the organic carbon was mobilised after demineralisation by treatment with 10% hydrofluouric acid (HF) and may therefore be adsorbed to the soil minerals. Our data indicated that there is, apart from root litter, a strong influence of soil-forming processes on the composition of organic carbon in subsoils. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

        "Comment": "Aims Predictions of medium to long-term changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks involve simulation models with plant carbon (C) inputs estimated from crop yields using crop harvest indices and allometric scaling involving fixed root-to-shoot ratios. The choice of allometric approach and initial distribution of SOC among model pools is crucial for model estimates. Methods We evaluated the impact of a modified allometric approach for grass leys and initial model set-up using the C-TOOL model. Four European agricultural long-term experiments were considered including three experiments with different frequency of grass leys in the crop rotation and one permanent grassland. Results The modified allometric function for ley relied on fixed below-ground C input regardless of mineral fertilizer inputs and modified pool initialization involved available site history. Including available, but insufficient, pre-experiment history to adjust the initial set-up of model SOC pools did not improve to the C-TOOL simulations. Changing the allometric approach for ley from fixed shoot-to-root ratios to fixed below-ground C input decreased the soil C input dramatically and improved the C-TOOL simulation of SOC stocks for fertilized treatments in all experiments when combined with standard model set-up. For unfertilized treatments, however, the efficiency of the standard allometric function was superior to the modified one. Conclusions Our results challenge the prevalent use of allometric approaches based on fixed root-to-shoot in SOC simulation models. The potential of modifying the initial distribution of SOC among model pools by accounting for historic land use remains in the dark.",

        "Comment": "We describe the use of a capillary rise method to measure the wettability of 10 samples of agricultural soil from Rothamsted long-term experimental sites. The samples have very similar clay contents, but organic carbon (C) contents range from 11.5 to 31.2 g kg(-1). Their wetting rates were interpreted by an improved method of data analysis, consistent with the Washburn equation, and showed an increase in the effective contact angle between the water meniscus and the soil with increasing C content. This corresponds to a decrease in wettability with increasing C content, and accords with other results reported in the literature. By contrast with water, we found that capillary rise for n-hexane into soil did not depend on the soil's bulk density or C content. A priori calculations of the expected wetting rates from fluid properties and an effective hydraulic radius estimated by other methods gave magnitudes and trends that agreed with our experimental data. The results show that estimates of effective hydraulic radius can provide a useful approximation for characterizing soil wetting, but that further modelling should be carried out.",

        "Comment": "Should the declining diversity of weed communities in conventionally managed arable fields be regarded as a problem? The answer to this question has tended to divide researchers into those whose primary focus is on conserving farmland biodiversity and those whose goals are dictated by weed control and maximising yield. Here, we argue that, regardless of how weeds are perceived, there are common ecological principles that should underpin any approach to managing weed communities, and, based on these principles, increasing in-field weed diversity could be advantageous agronomically as well as environmentally. We hypothesise that a more diverse weed community will be less competitive, less prone to dominance by highly adapted, herbicide-resistant species and that the diversity of the weed seedbank will be indicative of the overall sustainability of the cropping system. Common to these hypotheses is the idea that the intensification of agriculture has been accompanied by a homogenisation of cropping systems and landscapes, accounting for both declines in weed diversity and the reduced resilience of cropping systems (including the build-up of herbicide resistance). As such, weed communities represent a useful indicator of the success of rediversifying systems at multiple scales, which will be a central component of making agriculture and weed control more sustainable.",

        "Comment": "Simple measures of appropriate levels of soil organic matter are needed for soil evaluation, management and monitoring, based on readily measurable soil properties. We test an index of soil organic matter based on the soil organic carbon (SOC) to clay ratio, defined by thresholds of SOC/clay ratio for specified levels of soil structural quality. The thresholds were originally delineated for a small number of Swiss soils. We assess the index using data from the initial sampling (1978-83) of the National Soil Inventory of England and Wales, covering 3,809 sites under arable land, grassland and woodland. Land use, soil type, annual precipitation and soil pH together explained 21% of the variance in SOC/clay ratio in the dataset, with land use the most important variable. Thresholds of SOC/clay ratio of 1/8, 1/10 and 1/13 indicated the boundaries between \"very good\", \"good\", \"moderate\" and \"degraded\" levels of structural condition. On this scale, 38.2, 6.6 and 5.6% of arable, grassland and woodland sites, respectively, were degraded. The index gives a method to assess and monitor soil organic matter at national, regional or sub-regional scales based on two routinely measured soil properties. Given the wide range of soils and land uses across England and Wales in the dataset used to test the index, we suggest it should apply to other European soils in similar climate zones. Highlights We assess the use of SOC/clay ratios as guidelines for soil management in England and Wales. We use data from 3,809 sites to assess thresholds based on work for Polish, French and Swiss soils. SOC/clay threshold values can indicate degraded and good soil structural condition. The thresholds show the effect of land use and provide an index for use in England and Wales.",

        "Comment": "We used the PCR to study the presence of two plant pathogens in archived wheat samples from a long-term experiment started in 1843. The data were used to construct a unique 160-yr time-series of the abundance of Phaeosphaeria nodorum and Mycosphaerella graminicola, two important pathogens of wheat. During the period since 1970, the relative abundance of DNA of these two pathogens in the samples has reflected the relative importance of the two wheat diseases they cause in U.K. disease surveys. Unexpectedly, changes in the ratio of the pathogens over the 160-yr period were very strongly correlated with changes in atmospheric pollution, as measured by SO2. emissions. This finding suggests that long-term, economically important, changes in pathogen populations can be influenced by anthropogenically induced environmental changes.",

        "Comment": "Winter wheat is an important UK cereal, suited to the current climate. However, recent climate projections show changes in temperature and precipitation are likely, potentially affecting UK crop yields. Assessments of future yields contain several sources of uncertainty including those associated with climate and potential adaptation. Here we address these uncertainties using the CERES-Wheat model fed with an ensemble of regional model projections and different sowing dates and fertiliser regimes. In all of the 13 administrative  regions in the UK Climate Projections (UKCP09), increases in temperature accelerated the development rate of wheat, a result that was robust across the ensemble. This generally leads to positive impacts on yield and a northward shift in cultivation, with some decreases in the south. Uncertainties in yield became greater towards 2100, a result of corresponding increases in the uncertainty of climate changes. Sensitivity analysis suggests that CO2 fertilisation could compensate for yield losses due to changes in temperature and precipitation in most regions. Earlier sowings appear to be more beneficial in the future over the UK, whilst later sowings increase the risk of yield losses. In a warmer climate, increasing the amount of fertiliser did not improve yields and in fact increased the risk to productivity. Critically, adjustments to sowing date and fertiliser addition did not mitigate the loss of yield experienced in southern regions, suggesting limited adaptation potential in this case. We propose that regional yield changes may not be critical for wheat production in the UK as a whole, as losses in some regions are more than compensated for by gains in others.",

The soil at Woburn contained little free calcium carbonate, and soil pH was 6.1 in 1876. Consequently, where ammonium sulphate was applied (plots 2, 5 and 8) the soil soon became acidic and yields declined markedly within 20 years.

        "Comment": "The management of optimal soil pH is fundamental to sustainable crop production. Understanding the lime requirement for arable crops has developed gradually over the last several decades. The aim of this study was to examine the yield-pH relationship for a range of arable crops to understand their response to liming, based on the Long-Term Liming experiments established in 1962 at Rothamsted Research, UK. The main treatments of four different rates of lime and, therefore, four distinctly different soil pH levels were maintained for 35 years at two sites (Rothamsted and Woburn). The pH ranged from 4.4 to 8.0. The lime response was tested on the following crops: spring barley, spring oats, spring beans, spring lupins, winter lupins, potatoes, linseed, winter oilseed rape, winter triticale and winter wheat. Relative yield (RY) was used for non-linear regression analysis to detect site, year and phosphorus (P) fertiliser effects on the relationship with pH. Liming had a highly significant positive effect on soil pH, but overall there was no consistent increase or decrease in soil extractable P (Olsen) or exchangeable K. There were significant site effects detected for RY for most crops which reflect differences in the two soil types. Spring oats and potatoes had very weak  responses to lime within the pH range tested. For spring barley, winter triticale, winter wheat and winter oilseed rape significant effects of P fertiliser on the yield-pH relationship were found, although the nature of effects differed between crops and sites. Findings from the Long- Term Liming experiment are invaluable in improving the fundamental understanding on the yield-pH relationship for important arable crops and this has significant implications on selecting crops for rotations. The pH at 90% RY was calculated for selected crops and the beneficial effect of fertiliser P was detected in significantly reducing the critical pH value.",
