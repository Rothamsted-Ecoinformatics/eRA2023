		<p>The published datasets from Rothamsted's Long-term Experiments
			are important scientific research outputs from these experiments and
			must be properly cited if re-used or referred to in any publication
			or other output.</p>
		<p>Correct dataset citations:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>formally acknowledges the author's sources</li>
			<li>makes finding source data easier</li>
			<li>supports reproducible research</li>
			<li>allows the impact of datasets to be tracked and reported</li>
			<li>provides a structure which recognises data creators and
				curators</li>

		</ul>
		<p>All published datasets on e-RA are provided with a DataCite
			Digital Object Identifier (DOI).</p>
		<p>
			You must <b>ensure the dataset is correctly cited</b> and includes
			the dataset DOI, either where it is presented or in the reference
			list of any publications, reports or other outputs which use this
			dataset in whole or in part. Correct citation of datasets helps us to
			monitor their use and report their continuing impact to funders. We
			provide the appropriate citation example on most of our publications.
