	measured in the three weather

	The column <b>RAD</b>(calc) shows the value used in the calculations of the other derived variables
	(evaporation
	for example). It can be either RAD measured or RAD derived from SUN hours.
	The latter is now displayed in a red font to make it clear that this value is calculated from SUN hours. The

	however, the value of RAD(calc) is displayed in the same unit as the value of RAD obtained from the dataset,

			Correction to ROTHMET RAIN measurements before 2004</b></a>: Since April 2004 RAIN at Rothamsted
	(ROTHMET) has been measured with an ARG100 automatic tipping bucket. This has been found to capture 10% more

	data
	from 1990-2017 gave an overall correction factor of 10%.
	We recommend that when data is downloaded that spans both gauges, the 5 inch gauge data is multiplied by
	1.1, to
	make it comparable with data from the ARG100. This correction only applies to monthly or annual totals, and
	to
