No fertilizer was applied 1927-1940, and during this period the experiment was used to look at the residual effects of fertilizer applied from 1876-1926. In 1941 and 1942, basal N fertilizer was applied at the same rate to all plots. The whole experiment was fallowed (no crop sown) to control weeds in 1927, 1928, 1934 and 1935."

Straw yield does not include the stubble or all the chaff. Hectolitre weight, kg of grain per 100 litres, calculated from bushel weights, assuming 1 bushel is 36.369 litres. Winter wheat sown every year, except fallow years (no crop) and 1930, when the original winter wheat crop was so badly damaged by birds it had to be re-sown with spring wheat."

To ensure quality control during data inputting, the data sets were typed on two separate occasions (double data entry). During the second typing (verification) the data values were compared with those typed on the earlier occasion, and any discrepancies were resolved before verification continued. This procedure avoided visual checking of data, which can be very inaccurate."
