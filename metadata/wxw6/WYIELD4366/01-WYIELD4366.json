Winter wheat was grown every year until 1961 (apart from fallow years), then oats (1962) and spring beans (1964). The whole experiment was fallowed (no crop sown) to control weeds in 1947, 1948, 1955-57, 1963, 1965 and 1966. The experiment is a companion to the Woburn Continuous Barley Experiment."

            "description": "The Woburn Continuous Wheat Experiment started in autumn 1876 with a range of fertilizer and manure treatments applied until 1926. No fertilizer was applied 1927-1940. From 1943-1954 the plots were divided into sets of three and three N rates were applied to each set, in cyclic order. Plots 2, 5 and 8 were fallowed and not included in the fertilizer N treatments, as they were so acidic (due to the fertilizer treatments in 1877-1926). Lime was applied in 1955 to all plots to bring soil to about pH 6.0. Further lime was applied to selected areas 1956-1959.  In autumn 1962 the whole area was limed to bring pH to about 7. In 1959-1961 the plots were divided to compare barley and wheat. Microplot experiments were made on some plots in 1960-64; this data is not included. Basal fertilizer N was applied to all plots in 1959-1961 (barley and wheat) and in 1962 (oats)."

To ensure quality control during data inputting, the data sets were typed on two separate occasions (double data entry). During the second typing (verification) the data values were compared with those typed on the earlier occasion, and any discrepancies were resolved before verification continued. This procedure avoided visual checking of data, which can be very inaccurate."
