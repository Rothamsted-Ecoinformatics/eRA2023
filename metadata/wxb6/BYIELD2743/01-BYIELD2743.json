            "description": "The Woburn Continuous Barley Experiment was started in 1877, with a range of fertilizer and manure treatments applied until 1926. No fertilizer was applied 1927-1940 (except to some plots in 1931 and 1932), and during this period the experiment was used to look at the residual effects of fertilizer applied from 1877-1926. In 1941 and 1942, basal N fertilizer was applied at the same rate to all plots.  The plots were divided in half in 1931 and 1932 to test two spring barley cultivars. The whole experiment was fallowed (no crop sown) in 1927, 1928, 1934 and 1935."

To ensure quality control during data inputting, the data sets were typed on two separate occasions (double data entry). During the second typing (verification) the data values were compared with those typed on the earlier occasion, and any discrepancies were resolved before verification continued.  This procedure avoided visual checking of data, which can be very inaccurate."
