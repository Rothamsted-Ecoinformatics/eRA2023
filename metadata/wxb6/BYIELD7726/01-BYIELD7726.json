            "description": "This dataset contains the annual grain and straw yields of the Woburn Continuous Barley experiment, 1877-1926. Also grain %N for most plots and years. Details of the fertilizer, manure and lime treatments are also included.  There was a parallel experiment at Woburn testing the same treatments on the yield of continuous winter wheat. This experiment also mirrored the continuous spring barley experiment on the silty clay loam soil at Hoosfield, Rothamsted, started in 1852. The soil at Woburn contained little free calcium carbonate, and soil pH was 6.1 in 1876. Consequently, where ammonium sulphate was applied (plots 2, 5 and 8) the soil soon became acidic and yields declined markedly within 20 years. These were the first experiments in the UK where lime was applied to try to correct soil acidity."

Originally 11 plots (1-11), some were divided into sub-plots (a and b) from 1882, and into sub sub-plots (i and ii) from 1905, to test different treatments, mainly with and without lime.  To allow comparison of the different treatments, yields are shown for all 50 years for each sub-plot."

To ensure quality control during data inputting, the data sets were typed on two separate occasions (double data entry). During the second typing (verification) the data values were compared with those typed on the earlier occasion, and any discrepancies were resolved before verification continued. This procedure also set out how to handle situations where the written records were illegible or ambiguous. This procedure avoided visual checking of data, which can be very inaccurate."
