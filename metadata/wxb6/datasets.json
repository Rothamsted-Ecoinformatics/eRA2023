Baseline measurements were taken in November 1876 before the start of the experiment. The soil was then sampled from each plot in 1888, 1927 and 1932. Selected plots were also sampled in 1898, 1916 and 1922.  The dataset also contains details of the fertilizer, manure and lime treatments, 1876-1926. No fertilizer, manure or lime was applied after 1926. \r\nThe soil at Woburn contained little free calcium carbonate, and soil pH was 6.1 in 1876. Consequently, where ammonium sulphate was applied (plots 2, 5 and 8) the soil soon became acidic and yields declined markedly within 20 years. These were the first experiments in the UK where lime was applied to try to correct soil acidity.\r\n\r\nData from Crowther (1936) and Mattingly et al (1975), see Resource Provenance. ",

Details of the fertilizer, manure and lime treatments are also included.  There was a parallel experiment at Woburn testing the same treatments on the yield of continuous winter wheat. This experiment also mirrored the continuous spring barley experiment on the silty clay loam soil at Hoosfield, Rothamsted, started in 1852. The soil at Woburn contained little free calcium carbonate, and soil pH was 6.1 in 1876. Consequently, where ammonium sulphate was applied (plots 2, 5 and 8) the soil soon became acidic and yields declined markedly within 20 years.
