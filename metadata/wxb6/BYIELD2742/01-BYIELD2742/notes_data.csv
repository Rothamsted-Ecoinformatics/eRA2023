1,"According to the 1931 Annual Report:  'The 1931 season was unfavourable for corn crops in particular, wheat came up well during mild winter but cold spring and nearly sunless summer prevented crops from maturing well' http://www.era.rothamsted.ac.uk/eradoc/article/ResReport1931-93-100"
2,Estimated grain yield and bushel weight
3,"1931 and 1932 tested two barley varieties, Plumage and Archer, grown side by side on alternate strips on all the barley plots. Plot area assumed to be half usual size. Plots 8, 9, 10a and 11a received fertilizer as shown"
4,"Average bushel weights all plots 1931 Plumage except 7, 8aa,8bb, 9a, 9b and 11b"
5,"Average bushel weights all plots 1931 Archer except 6, 8aa,8bb, 9a, 9b, 11a and 11b"
6,According to the 1933 Annual Report: 'The plots were very weedy especially with spurry' (assumed to be Spergula arvensis) http://www.era.rothamsted.ac.uk/eradoc/article/ResReport1933-87-92
7,According to the 1936 Annual Report: 'Ripened unevenly with damp and weedy straw' http://www.era.rothamsted.ac.uk/eradoc/article/ResReport1936-157-161
8,"According to the 1937 Annual Report: 'The crop in 1937 was substantially a failure. Wet early spring 1937, impossible to get a good seed bed. Sown on a very poor tilth on March 31st.  The crop never flourished and yields were very poor. ' http://www.era.rothamsted.ac.uk/eradoc/article/ResReport1937-110-115"
9,"1941 8aa and 8bb plots combined at harvest, so the yields are the same"
10,Fallow - no crop sown. Yields shown as blank cell.
