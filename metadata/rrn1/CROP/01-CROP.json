The experiment was designed to test the effects of different rotations with and without leys (short-term herbage) on the yield of three arable test crops. It is now an important resource for investigating long-term changes in soil organic matter due to different cropping systems.\r\n\r\nThis dataset was assembled by Fergus Blyth from September 2022 to August 2023 as part of a year spent on placement for an MSci degree from the University of Glasgow.\r\n\r\nThis work was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council [NE/S007423/1], through the ENVISION Doctoral Training Partnership, Research Experience Placement scheme.

            "description": "The experiment was started in 1949 to test the effects of different 3-year ley treatments on the yields of 3 arable test crops. From 1968, blocks 5-12 were turned over to continuous wheat cropping to study the effects of take-all disease and are not included further in this dataset, except the 1st, 2nd and 3rd test crops in blocks 6, 7, 10 and 11, which continued until 1971. Blocks 1-4 are maintained to this day, although the measuring of yields was halted in 1990. The experiment began with a cut-grass (Cg) treatment, a grazed ley (L) treatment, a lucerne treatment (Lu) and an arable with hay treatment (A). The crops and treatments used in the arable with hay treatment changed several times over the course of the experiment. Additionally, plots of old grassland from before the experiment (G) were left for comparison with the ley treatments, and some plots were sown with reseeded grass (R). The (L) and (Cg) treatments were discontinued in 1962 in favour of a clover-grass (Lc) and an all-grass (Ln) treatment, respectively. Some (R) plots were ploughed up and converted to the arable with hay treatment in the late 1960s, before being returned to reseeded grass in the 1970s under the name (Rp). (Lu) and (Ln) plots were converted to (Lc) plots in 1991, and (G) and (R) or (Rp) plots were titled (Gc) and (Rc) or (Rpc) from 1991 onwards to reflect the halting of nitrogen tests on the plots. Several changes were made in 2009: The (Lc) plots that had previously been (Lu) were turned over to (A) treatment, and the (Lc) plots that had previously been (Ln) were turned over to permanent fallow (F). The (Rc) and (Rpc) plots and pre-existing (A) plots were turned over to the Highfield Reversion then became known as the Conversion Experiment (R/CS/767). "
