%X Cropping details of the Highfield Ley-arable experiment, 1949-2023, with details of the arable and ley-arable rotation sequences in each of the twelve blocks, and the different treatment crops and varieties. The experiment was designed to test the effects of different rotations with and without leys (short-term herbage) on the yield of three arable test crops, in a site that had been in long-term grassland. Additionally, plots of old grassland from before the experiment started were left for comparison with the ley treatments, and other plots were ploughed and reseeded with grass at the start of the experiment. This is a companion to the Fosters ley arable experiment, started at the same time on a site that had been in long-term arable. It is now an important resource for investigating long-term changes in soil organic matter due to different cropping systems.
