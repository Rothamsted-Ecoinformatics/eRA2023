1,"This plot was cut for silage, rather than being grazed by sheep. Shown as RS or GS on some plans in some years."
2,Plots turned over to Highfield Conversion Experiment from 2009 onwards and are no longer part of the Highfield Ley-Arable Experiment - see https://www.era.rothamsted.ac.uk/experiment/rcs767
3,Plots 33 and 34 were mistakenly ploughed up in 1963 and sown to wheat in 1964 before being returned to permanent grass in 1965. Represented by [] brackets around the rotation code.
4,A hay crop was taken from the grass plot this year instead of grazing sheep on it. Shown as Rh or Gh on some plans in some years.
5,See supplementary information seed mixture for information on ley treatment seed mixture composition. No information is available on grass/clover seed mixtures sown after 1990
6,Cropping plan for 1993 missing - crop cultivars inferred from those used in years directly before and after 1993
7,These permanent grass plots were turned over to test cropping for their last three years in the Highfield ley-arable experiment 
8,"In the 1960s, these reseeded grass plots were ploughed up and converted to the arable with hay treatment rotation, either until 1973 or until their block was phased out of the experiment."
