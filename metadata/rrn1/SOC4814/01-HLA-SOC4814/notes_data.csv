1,"Value for 0-23cm (0-9"") calculated from a measurement for 0-13cm (0-5"") and a measurement for 13-25cm (5-10"")"
2,"Value for 0-23cm (0-9"") calculated from a measurement for 0-15cm (0-6"") and an assumed value for 15-23cm (6-9"") calculated from 13-25cm (5-10"") measurements from 1948"
3,"Value for 0-23cm (0-9"") calculated from a measurement taken for 0-15cm (0-6"") and a value calculated for 15-23cm (6-9"") based on values measured for 15-30cm (6-12"")"
4,"Value for 0-23cm (0-9"") calculated from bulked samples from 0-15cm (0-6"") and 15-30cm (6-12"")"
5,Sampled as whole pairs of plots rather than separate Gc and Gn sub-plots
6,Sampled as whole pairs of plots rather than separate Rc and Rn sub-plots
7,"Square bracket around G or Gc indicates this permanent grass plot was mistakenly ploughed up in 1963 and seeded under wheat in 1964 before being returned to permanent grass in 1965. Although measurements for subplots exist for these particular plots, they were not subjected to Gc vs Gn treatments after the error and therefore should be excluded from any analyses focusing on continuous permanent grass plots."
8,"In 1951, data for the A, Lu, Cg and L plots are from bulked samples from these plots; at this time Lu, Cg and L plots in blocks I & II had not yet been phased into leys"
9,"Date for 1956 sampling was recorded as ""Spring"" with no specific month or day"
10,"Total N, total C and SOC values for permanent grass plots for this year are from the analysis of soil sampled with a 15x15x23cm (6x6x9"") metal box; values for these plots taken by auger appeared to be too high."
11,These plots were turned over to the Highfield Reversion Experiment in autumn 2008 and are no longer part of the Highfield Ley-Arable experiment
12,"There were major changes to the experiment in 2009 (see cropping plans). These plots became fallow, and were sampled in 2011. Other plots were not sampled in 2011."
13,"This reseeded grass plot was converted into an arable rotation between 1963 and 1973. It was resown to grass with nitrogen (Rpn) or grass/clover (Rpc) in 1973, and no bulk density values are available."
