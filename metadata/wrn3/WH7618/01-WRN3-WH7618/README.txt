|crop_data.csv|crop yield  data|This is the main data table, containing the yield of wheat grown as the first test crop, 1976-2018. This dataset only contains plots on which wheat was grown as the first test crop in a given year. So for example, all plots in block 3 had wheat planted to them in 1976, but there is no data for any other blocks this year because none were growing wheat as the first test crop. ''Test crop' refers to a major cash crop on which the effects of the different arable rotations and leys were assessed. These have changed throughout the experiment, and the first test crop has been wheat since 1976. The rotations are typically 3 years of 'treatment crops' followed by two years of 'test crops' (the exception are the eight-year ley treatments).

### Abstract
Annual grain yield for the winter wheat test crop, on the Woburn Ley-Arable experiment, 1976-2018, with treatment details.
### Methods
The Woburn Ley-arable experiment was started in 1938, to compare the effects of different rotations, with and without grass or grass/clover leys, on soil organic matter and the yield of two arable test crops.  'Test crop' refers to a major cash crop on which the effects of the different arable rotations and leys were assessed. The rotations are typically three years of 'treatment crops' followed by two years of 'test crops' (the exception are the eight-year ley treatments). The two test crops have changed throughout the experiment, and the first test crop has been wheat since 1976.  This dataset contains the yield of wheat grown as the first test crop, 1976-2018, plus details of the N fertilizer treatments, basal fertilizer, sowing and harvest dates.
### Technical Info
Wheat grain yield at harvest at 85% dry matter content. Winter wheat was grown every year, except for 2015, when the spring wheat variety Mulika was sown, as the winter wheat crop failed.
### Quality
In accordance with the Joint Code of Practice for Research at Rothamsted, data processing in e-RA follow rigorous standard operating procedures to ensure the quality and correctness of data collected in the field through to depositing in the e-RA database. Once the data were entered into e-RA, they were independently back-checked against the original data sheets.

####crop yield  data

This is the main data table, containing the yield of wheat grown as the first test crop, 1976-2018. This dataset only contains plots on which wheat was grown as the first test crop in a given year. So for example, all plots in block 3 had wheat planted to them in 1976, but there is no data for any other blocks this year because none were growing wheat as the first test crop. ''Test crop' refers to a major cash crop on which the effects of the different arable rotations and leys were assessed. These have changed throughout the experiment, and the first test crop has been wheat since 1976. The rotations are typically 3 years of 'treatment crops' followed by two years of 'test crops' (the exception are the eight-year ley treatments). Also contains details of N fertilizer treatments, basal P, K and S fertilizer applications, sowing and harvest dates and wheat variety. Grain yields at 85% dry matter
