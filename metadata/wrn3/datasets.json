Updated from Version 1, with addition of a cropping database. The experiment was designed to test the effects of different rotations with and without leys (short-term herbage) on the yield of two arable Test crops. It is now an important resource for investigating long-term changes in soil organic matter due to different cropping systems. ",

Baseline measurements were taken in March 1938 at the start of the experiment, then the soil in each block was sampled regularly every five years from 1955, to coincide with the end of the third treatment year or the last year of the eight-year leys. Soil N was measured from 1980 onwards. Also included are estimates of soil bulk density. This dataset must be read in conjunction with **Johnston et al, 2017 **, which gives the full background, summarises the %SOC data (mean of the five blocks), and gives estimates of total organic carbon in t/ha and estimated annual inputs of C from each rotation.",
