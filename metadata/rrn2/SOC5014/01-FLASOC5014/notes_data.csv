1,"Baseline samples were bulked from 42 site samples taken from Blocks 10, 11 and 12, in September 1950, before experimental cropping had started on these blocks, and are assumed to be very similar to the starting values for Blocks 1-4 in autumn 1948. "
2,"Value for 0-23cm (0-9"") calculated from a measurement for 0-15cm (0-6"") and estimated values for 15-17cm (6-7"") and 17-23cm (7-9"") that were themselves derived from 15-30cm (6-12"") measurements from 1961"
3,"Date for 1956 sampling was recorded as ""Spring"" with no specific month or day"
4,"Value for 0-23cm (0-9"") calculated from measurements taken for 0-15cm (0-6"") and estimated values for 15-17cm (6-7"") and 17-23cm (7-9"") that were themselves derived from measurements taken that year for 15-30cm (6-12"")"
5,"Value for 0-23cm (0-9"") calculated from bulked samples from 0-15cm (0-6"") and 15-30cm (6-12"")"
6,Sampled as whole pairs of plots rather than separate Rc and Rn plots
7,"These reseeded grass plots were converted into an arable rotation between 1963 and 1973. They were resown to grass with nitrogen or grass/clover in 1973, and no bulk density values are available."
8,"Total N, total C and SOC values for reseeded grass plots for this year are from the analysis of soil sampled with a 15x15x23cm (6x6x9"") metal box; values for these plots taken by auger appeared to be too high."
9,"There were major changes to the experiment in 2009 (see cropping plans). These plots became fallow, and were sampled in 2011. Other plots were not sampled in 2011."
