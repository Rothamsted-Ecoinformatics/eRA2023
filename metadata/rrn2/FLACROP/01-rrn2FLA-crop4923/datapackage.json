      "description": "The experiment was started in 1949 to test the effects of different 3 year ley treatments on the yields of 3 arable test crops, in a site that had been in long-term arable.  Additionally, some plots were sown with permanent grass. This is a companion to the Highfield ley arable experiment, started at the same time on a site that had been in long-term grassland. The main data table consists of the treatment rotations followed and crops grown in each plot and block each year. It contains the rotations, the crop codes (crop types) and crop varieties. At conception, it consisted of 120 main plots, divided over 12 blocks. From 1968, blocks 5-12 were turned over to continuous wheat cropping to study the effects of take-all disease and are not included further in this dataset, except the 1st, 2nd and 3rd test crops in blocks 8, 9, 10 and 12, which continued until 1971. Blocks 1-4 are maintained to this day, although the measuring of yields was halted in 1990.  The experiment began with a cut-grass (Cg) treatment, a grazed ley (L) treatment, a lucerne treatment (Lu), a reseeded grass treatment (R) and an arable with hay treatment (A), which was intended to provide a continuous arable plot for comparison to the permanent grass plot on Highfield.  The crops and treatments used in the A treatment changed several times over the course of the experiment.  The L and Cg treatments were discontinued in 1962 in favour of a clover-grass (Lc) and an all-grass (Ln) treatment, respectively. Some R plots were ploughed up and converted to the arable with hay treatment in the late 1960s, before being returned to reseeded grass in the 1970s (Rp). The R and Rp treatments were divided into two subplots (1 and 2) from 1962-1990 to test grass with nitrogen (n) and grass/clover (c). From 1991 the R and Rp plots were no longer split and were all under grass/clover, called Rc or Rpc. The Lu and Ln plots were converted to Lc plots in 1991. In 2009 the Lc plots that had previously been Ln were turned over to permanent fallow F.  Today the experiment's main purpose is to evaluate the effects of different cropping systems on long-term changes in soil organic carbon. See Fosters Supplementary Information for more details. "

  "description": "### Abstract\nCropping details of the Fosters Ley-arable experiment, 1949-2023, with details of the arable and ley-arable rotation sequences in each of the twelve blocks, and the different treatment crops and varieties. The experiment was designed to test the effects of different rotations with and without leys (short-term herbage) on the yield of three arable test crops in a site that had been in long-term arable. Additionally, some plots were ploughed and sown with permanent grass. This is a companion to the Highfield ley arable experiment, started at the same time on a site that had been in long-term grassland. It is now an important resource for investigating long-term changes in soil organic matter due to different cropping systems.\r\n\r\nThis dataset was assembled by Fergus Blyth from September 2022 to August 2023 as part of a year spent on placement for an MSci degree from the University of Glasgow.\r\n\r\nThis work was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council [NE/S007423/1], through the ENVISION Doctoral Training Partnership, Research Experience Placement scheme.\n### Methods\nThe main data table consists of the treatment rotations followed and crops grown in each plot and block each year. It contains the rotations, the crop codes (crop types) and crop varieties. Originally, it consisted of 120 main plots, divided over 12 blocks. From 1968, blocks 5-12 were turned over to continuous wheat cropping to study the effects of take-all disease and are not included further in this dataset, except the 1st, 2nd and 3rd test crops in blocks 8, 9, 10 and 12, which continued until 1971. Blocks 1-4 are maintained to this day, although the measuring of yields was halted in 1990.  \r\n\r\nThe experiment began with a cut-grass (Cg) treatment, a grazed ley (L) treatment, a lucerne treatment (Lu), a reseeded grass treatment (R) and an arable with hay treatment (A), which was intended to provide a continuous arable plot for comparison to the permanent grass plot on Highfield.  The crops and treatments used in the A treatment changed several times over the course of the experiment.  The L and Cg treatments were discontinued in 1962 in favour of a clover-grass (Lc) and an all-grass (Ln) treatment, respectively. Some R plots were ploughed up and converted to the arable with hay treatment in the late 1960s, before being returned to reseeded grass in the 1970s (Rp). The R and Rp treatments were divided into two subplots (1 and 2) from 1962-1990 to test grass with nitrogen (n) and grass/clover (c). From 1991 the R and Rp plots were no longer split and were all under grass/clover, called Rc or Rpc. The Lu and Ln plots were converted to Lc plots in 1991. In 2009 the Lc plots that had previously been Ln were turned over to permanent fallow F.\n### Technical Info\nThe main plots are in pairs. At conception, it consisted of 120 main plots, divided over 12 blocks. It now numbers 40 plots, divided over 4 blocks.  The year refers to harvest year; the experiment was started in autumn 1948 with the first crop harvested in 1949.\n### Other\n\n### Provenance\nTaken from the Rothamsted Yield Books, field plans and paper archive.\n### Quality\nThe frictionless dataset of crop sequence data was compiled by Fergus Blyth and checked by Margaret Glendining and Sarah Perryman, July 2023.\n",
