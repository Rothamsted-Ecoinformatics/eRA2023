%X Cropping details of the Fosters Ley-arable experiment, 1949-2023, with details of the arable and ley-arable rotation sequences in each of the twelve blocks, and the different treatment crops and varieties. The experiment was designed to test the effects of different rotations with and without leys (short-term herbage) on the yield of three arable test crops in a site that had been in long-term arable. Additionally, some plots were ploughed and sown with permanent grass. This is a companion to the Highfield ley arable experiment, started at the same time on a site that had been in long-term grassland. It is now an important resource for investigating long-term changes in soil organic matter due to different cropping systems.
