2,"All plots divided into two sub-plots in 1998 when fodder beet was grown. There are no sub-plots in the other years. Sub-plot 1 = down hill, sub-plot 2 = up hill. Assume these are different sample positions. "
3,"Sugar beet components of yield as measured at Broom's Barn Experimental Station, Dec 10th 1992"
