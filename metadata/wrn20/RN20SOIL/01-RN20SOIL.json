The soil from each plot was sampled once each year in 1991, 1992, 1993 and 1996 and analysed for total carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentration (%). Total N was also measured in 1989. Data is for topsoil (0-10, 15 or 20cm) plus 50-60cm in 1992 only. This is the data described by Quinton et al, 2006. Clay content was also measured in 1996, as reported by Quinton and Catt, 2007. The experiment had eight plots, in a 2x2 factorial, with two blocks. Treatments were two directions of cultivation (cultivated and drilled parallel to the contour <i>v</i> up and down the slope) and two types of cultivation (standard cultivation, residue removed <i>v</i> minimal tillage, residues retained).  \r\n\r\nCrop yield and erosion and runoff data is published separately.

            "description": "The experiment was situated on a sandy soil at Woburn Experimental Farm (Great Hill II/III) on a five-degree slope, which had been subject to periodic erosion since at least 1950. The eight plots were approximately 24 x 36m (0.086 ha), separated by grassed earth banks 1m wide and 30cm high which prevented runoff and eroded soil leaving the plots. Four plots were cultivated and drilled parallel to the contour, and four up and down the slope. Four plots received standard cultivations and four minimal tillage.  All plots grew the same crops each year, in a rotation typical of the sandy soils of Bedfordshire.  The soil was sampled on a grid with nine or 12 samples from each plot. In 1991 several samples were taken and bulked together for analysis. "

Between crops soil was left in post-harvest condition, covered with stubble and crop residues until cultivated for the seedbed. \r\n\r\n**Standard tillage:**  cereal straw baled and removed, potato haulm and beet tops raked up and removed, plots ploughed with a general purpose mouldboard plough to 25cm depth. Between crops soil was in bare fallow after ploughing. "
