        "description": "Eight plots situated on a slope of about 5 degrees, (7-13%), each separated by a grass bank. The eroded soil and runoff were collected in tanks at the end of each plot after recent erosion. Four plots were cultivated and drilled parallel to the contour, and four up and down the slope. All plots grew the same crops each year, in a rotation typical of the sand soil of Bedfordshire. Four plots received standard cultivation and four minimal tillage.",
