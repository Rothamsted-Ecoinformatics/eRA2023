Two types of cultivation (standard cultivation, residue removed v minimal tillage, residues retained). The two blocks had slightly different cropping histories before the experiment began. Standard cultivation was by moldboard plough to approximately 25cm depth. Minimal tillage was by shallow tines or discs to 10cm depth."
