Also annual fertilizer applications. There were eight plots, in a 2x2 factorial, with two blocks. Treatments were two directions of cultivation (cultivated and drilled parallel to the contour v up and down the slope) and two types of cultivation (standard cultivation, residue removed v minimal tillage, residues retained). All plots grew the same crops each year, in a rotation typical of the sandy soils of Bedfordshire. ",

Data is for topsoil (0-10, 15 or 20cm) plus 50-60cm in 1992 only. This is the data described by Quinton et al, 2006. Clay content was also measured in 1996, as reported by Quinton and Catt, 2007.
